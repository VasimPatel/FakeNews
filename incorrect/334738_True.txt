RIA cited the ministry as saying NATO had no reason to worry about the battle group NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned on Tuesday that the ships, headed for Syria, could be used to target civilians in the besieged city of Aleppo and to launch more air strikes. \\n(MOSCOW) - Andrei Kelin , a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, told RIA Stoltenberg's statement was unhelpful. \\n\\\"The concerns are not based on anything as our planes have not come near Aleppo for nine days. Our battle group is in the Mediterranean. Our ships have always had a presence there,\\\" said Kelin. \\n\\\"Why make some spurious suggestions and then make some political recommendations based on them? It is of course absurd.\\\" \\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has questioned Russia's statements about a moratorium on bombing Aleppo, saying the city has been hit by strikes since a lull in fighting ended on Saturday.\"}"
