Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nTrump being Trump, he stepped on stage and immediately wrecked any chance Republicans had of taking advantage of the email story. \\nTrump went into full hyperbolic overdrive in New Hampshire by claiming that the FBI\\u2019s reopening of the investigation was \\u201cbigger than Watergate.\\u201d \\nThe Republican nominee took back his claim that the system is rigged. \\nVideo: Following FBI announcement into Clinton's emails, Trump remarks, \\\"The system might not be as rigged as I thought.\\\" https://t.co/7kI3UXbveF \\n\\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 28, 2016 \\nTrump said, \\u201cBut, with what I\\u2019ve just announced, previously, it might not be as rigged as I thought. Right? The FBI. I think they\\u2019re going to right the ship, folks. I think they\\u2019re going to right the ship, and they\\u2019re going to save their great reputation by doing so.\\u201d The speculation is that the FBI is likely to review the new emails and stick by their original finding that Hillary Clinton did nothing wrong. \\nTrump and the Republicans are jumping to some conclusions. They know that Clinton is guilty without any evidence to support their beliefs. They are assuming that the FBI is going to find evidence that Hillary Clinton did something wrong, and they think that the emails are their ticket to getting Trump elected. \\nTrump has no political skills, and no idea when to use a gentle touch and stop. The Republican nominee destroyed any hope that the GOP had of using the reopened email investigation to their advantage by letting his habits of lying and changing positions on a whim take hold. \\nThe email scandal isn\\u2019t going to help Republicans. It hasn\\u2019t before, and it won\\u2019t now, but Trump\\u2019s over the top incompetence has killed any boost that Republicans might have gotten from the story.\", \"article_id\": 323491, \"title\": \"Trump Wrecks Any Hope GOP Had Of Taking Advantage Of Clinton Email Investigation\", \"source_id\": 8910}"
