Observations by NASA\\u2019s Kepler space telescope showed that the star dimmed dramatically several times over the past half-decade or so, at one point by a whopping 22 percent. These occasional brightness dips \\u2014 which were first reported last year by a team led by Yale University postdoc Tabetha Boyajian (hence the star\\u2019s nickname) \\u2014 are far too substantial to be caused by an orbiting planet, astronomers have said.\\nSo researchers have offered up a number of alternative explanations for the dimming to date. Perhaps a cloud of comet fragments periodically blocks the star\\u2019s light, for example, or maybe some unknown structure in the depths of space between Earth and Tabby\\u2019s star is responsible.\\nIt\\u2019s even possible that the brightness dips are caused by an \\u201calien megastructure\\u201d \\u2014 an enormous collection of energy-gathering solar panels, for example.\\nAstronomers have stressed that the megastructure hypothesis is a long shot, but long shots shouldn\\u2019t be dismissed out of hand, Breakthough Listen team members said.\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s very likely \\u2014 a one-in-a-billion chance or something like that \\u2014 but nevertheless, we\\u2019re going to check it out,\\u201d Dan Werthimer, chief scientist at Berkeley SETI, said in the same statement . \\u201cBut I think that E.T., if it\\u2019s ever discovered, it might be something like that. It\\u2019ll be some bizarre thing that somebody finds by accident \\u2026 that nobody expected, and then we look more carefully and we say, \\u2018Hey, that\\u2019s a civilization.'\\u201d\\nA number of other research teams have already searched for signals coming from Tabby\\u2019s star, and all of those searches have come up empty so far.\\nSiemion, Boyajian and astronomer Jason Wright, who\\u2019s based at Pennsylvania State University, will discuss the planned Tabby\\u2019s star observations during a video chat from the Green Bank Telescope site on Wednesday at 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT).
