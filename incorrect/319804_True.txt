However, the coalition forces reveal it was heading towards Mecca. \\nThe Yemeni Shiite Houthis have always wanted to send a long suppository to Saudi Arabia and so they developed scuds, Burkan 1 ( Volcano 1), range 800 kilometers. Not only did they develop it, but they fired a couple of these babies just a few weeks ago towards Saudi Arabia\\u2019s Fahd Air Base, near Mecca. \\nHere the previous launch from Yemen: \\nBut this time the target was Mecca, Allah\\u2019s House (Bait Allah). Iran says that Karbala is Allah\\u2019s favorite vacation house, not Mecca, which Iran promised that Allah will penetrate with a scud as a last one night-stand with the veiled Burqa dressed Kaaba. \\nBut the developments of scuds by Yemeni Shiites is not that simple to ignore by Saudi Arabia, which plays a game of cat and mouse with these rebels playing with some serious fire. On August 28th, Saudi Arabia had to send a jet just before this other scud was about to take off destroying it on the ground and at times have the patriots intercept. \\n\\nThis time the coalition forces destroyed the base of the Mecc-scud: \\nAllah in the Quran promised he protects the Kaaba from destruction while the Hadith says in the end it will be destroyed. As it seems, this time the whore of Babylon escaped, but her destruction is well etched in scripture so for now enjoy the weddings. \\nArticle posted with permission from Shoebat.com  \"}"
