"{\"content\": \"Entitled Customer Slams Restaurant On Yelp, What Happens Next Is Sheer Badassery By Tiffany Willis on October 11, 2014 Subscribe \\nA customer ( Yelp name Sonal B) was visiting Kansas City for a conference when she decided to try to get take-out food from Voltaire , \\u201can upscale restaurant across the street from her conference building. The only problem with that is that Voltaire doesn\\u2019t offer take-out and they never have, by policy.\\u201d The customer pitched a fit, threatened to get her \\u201clawyer\\u201d husband involved (and did), and threatened the manager with a bad Yelp review, which she did minutes after leaving the restaurant. \\nBut Voltaire\\u2019s owner responded. And it was fabulous. \\nThe Yelp review: Most unfriendly and arrogant restaurant in KC. Just called Voltaire to try to order some food because we\\u2019re in a late business meeting across the street. First, they refused to answer our question about what type of broth is used in the risotto. Then they said they won\\u2019t pack food to go. My husband spoke to the manager and explained that we\\u2019re in a conference room across the street, and asked if they can pack our dinner (which we would pick up). The hostess flat-out refused to answer our question about the food or to try and work with us so we could get food in our meeting. My husband asked to speak with the manager. The manager, Jamie, said, \\u201cour food is plated beautifully, and we can\\u2019t put it in a \\u2018to go\\u2019 container.\\u201d So thanks, Jamie, we\\u2019ll just starve. (What the manager said is just not true by the way we\\u2019ve eaten there before, and they did pack our food to go.) When my husband said that he was going to post a Yelp review about the way the restaurant was treating us, the manager questioned, \\u201cAre you a grown man and an adult?\\u201d Yes, Jamie, we are grown adults, and we do not do business with people who behave like you do. We regularly travel to NYC and eat at a variety of restaurants, which are more than happy to accommodate people by packing food to go. This restaurant thinks they\\u2019re too good for their customers. They will soon learn that if you ignore your customers, they\\u2019re going to start ignoring you. I would not even give this place one star after this experience, and I\\u2019m dismayed by their unprofessional and arrogant behavior. \\nThe owner\\u2019s response: I sincerely apologize that we don\\u2019t offer \\u2018take-out\\u2019 food at our restaurant. Being a Yelp user, I\\u2019m sure you were aware that on our Yelp business page, on the right side of the screen, it lists details about our establishment. There is an item listed \\u2018Take-Out : No.\\u2019 We have never offered take-out food as we believe the food we prepare should be presented as we see fit, (usually) on a plate inside the dining room. As for the risotto, its made with a vegetable stock \\u2013 this dish is vegetarian, and I\\u2019m certain that who you were speaking with wanted to make extra certain the information provided to you was accurate. On your previous visits, you say you have witnessed dishes being boxed up as proof that we provide \\u2018take-out\\u2019 food. Although we do allow our guests to take their uneaten food with them in to-go boxes after they have dined with us, we have never offered \\u2018take-out\\u2019 food. If you were actually starving, as in a life threatening condition requiring nutritional sustenance, we would be happy to assist you..we do make exceptions for emergency situations. Our general manager did question the age/maturity of your husband after he became combative and threatened us with a negative Yelp review if we did not alter our operational practice and provide him with \\u2018take-out\\u2019 food. 15 minutes later you indeed came through with this threat. I can assure you that we don\\u2019t offer \\u2018take-out\\u2019 food because we feel we are \\u2018too good\\u2019 for our customers; we just prefer to have our guests dine with us, allowing for the proper presentation (and temperature) of their fare that has been skillfully prepared by our kitchen. I am very pleased that you frequent New York. We travel often as well. And I can assure you that there are many restaurants in NYC that do not offer \\u2018take-out\\u2019 food. Although there are many other options that do \\u2013 in Kansas City as well (Go Royals!). It was made REPEATEDLY clear in the conversation with your husband that he is a lawyer. Let me provide the following analogy/role reversal-it may assist in clarifying your request. YOU: I want to hire you to handle my divorce. ME: But, I\\u2019m a tax lawyer. YOU: I don\\u2019t care I want you to handle my divorce. ME: Sorry, but I don\\u2019t practice that form of law. YOU: Just handle my divorce, I\\u2019ll pay you-it will be fine. ME: I don\\u2019t feel comfortable providing my services as a divorce lawyer, as I am a tax lawyer. You won\\u2019t receive the service you are wanting or that I am willing to provide. YOU: Well, I travel to NYC often, and in NYC, Tax lawyers handle my divorce litigation all the time. I don\\u2019t know what the problem is. I\\u2019ve told you I\\u2019m a chef, right? ME: Well, that\\u2019s nice sir, but I really can\\u2019t help you. It goes against my business practice. YOU: If you don\\u2019t represent me in my divorce, I\\u2019m going to post it all over the [most frequented social media review of lawyers] that you refused to provide me with the service I requested, and make baseless allegations about how you are very pretentious, arrogant and unprofessional. I will also try to prevent you from getting any additional business by damning you on said social media platform. Now will you represent me? ME: I don\\u2019t take kindly to threats. Thanks for your feedback. We will let you know if we decide in the future to practice divorce law, I mean, provide \\u2018take-out\\u2019 food. \\nLet us know your thoughts at the Liberal America Facebook page .
