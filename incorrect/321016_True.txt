Ex-student sues NJ college over alleged 'brutal' gang rape at frat house, dorm https://t.co/84VQ1uKHZY \\u2014 New Jersey 101.5 (@nj1015) October 25, 2016 \\nAccording to northjersey.com , the victim was greeted at her dorm door by a fraternity member in a tuxedo, who was reportedly \\u201cassigned\\u201d to get girls to come to the party. \\nOnce the victim was there, court documents reveal she became drunk to the point of unconsciousness and woke up after attending the party, felt she had been sexually assaulted, and went to Hackensack University Medical Center. Officials there found lacerations \\u201cconsistent with non-consensual sex.\\u201d \\nThe teen, who goes by \\u201cJane Doe\\u201d in the lawsuit, claims she was gang raped by tuxedo-wearing Christopher A. Lopez and another student, Nakeem Gardner, who are now 26 and 22 years old. \\nThe New York Daily News reports Lopez and Gardner even played the game \\u201crock, paper, scissors\\u201d to decide who would have sex with the female student first. \\nAnd the abuse allegedly didn't end there. NJ.com reports: \\nAfter the initial sexual assault, the teen was involuntarily moved \\u201cwithout her shoes, underwear and jacket\\u201d across campus to Mackin Hall, where she was raped by others, the lawsuit claims. \\nThe suit alleges some of the male students \\u201cwere falling-down laughing hysterically while also videotaping the sexual assault\\u201d on a cell phone. \\nThree other students \\u2014 Christopher Rainone, 20, Jordyn Massood, 20, and Justin Sommers, 20 \\u2014 were also charged in connection to the alleged assault. \\nLopez and Gardner were charged with second degree sexual assault for allegedly gang raping the victim. Rainone, Massod and Sommers were charged with failing to aid the victim and for videotaping her while she was naked. \\nAll five former students have been indicted in connection with the alleged attacks, but pleaded not guilty in July 2016, and were offered a plea deal as a result.
