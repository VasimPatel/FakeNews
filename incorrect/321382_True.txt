"{\"title\": \"The future of civil rights is up to the Supreme Court\", \"content\": \"The future of civil rights is up to the Supreme Court A single court seat can change the landscape of our liberties\\u2014and this election could determine four. By Mary Frances Berry Posted on November 4, 2016 by Mary Frances Berry \\nWhen 95-year-old Rosanell Eaton first registered to vote in the Jim Crow South, she was forced to pass a written literacy test and recite the preamble of the Constitution from memory. Seven decades after becoming one of the first African American voters in her county, Eaton once again found herself facing obstacles undermining her access to the franchise. \\nBecause of North Carolina\\u2019s harsh new voting restrictions, Eaton had to make 11 trips to various state agencies\\u2014traveling a total of over 200 miles \\u2014to get the identification she needed to vote. \\nSo Eaton challenged the state\\u2019s voter ID laws in a case that made its way to the nation\\u2019s highest court. After an appeals court struck down the restrictions, the Supreme Court\\u2014in a 4\\u20134 tie vote this August\\u2014declined for now to reinstate them, pending an eventual appeal. \\nEaton\\u2019s harrowing story demonstrates the powerful role of each Supreme Court justice. Had there been one more conservative justice sitting on the court, North Carolina voters like Eaton would be facing the controversial, discriminatory barriers she challenged this November. \\nAs with so many decisions in our country\\u2019s history, the protection of Americans\\u2019 fundamental rights came down to a single seat on the Supreme Court. It was only by one vote, after all, that the court decided the damaging Shelby County case in 2013, which gutted the Voting Rights Act\\u2014a landmark achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement\\u2014and allowed North Carolina to establish these discriminatory voting restrictions in the first place. \\nAs powerful as a single Supreme Court seat can be, more than one seat hangs in the balance this November. The next president could nominate up to four justices for lifetime appointments on the Supreme Court. The outcome of the election may well determine the composition of our nation\\u2019s most powerful court for decades\\u2014and with it, the future of our civil rights. \\nBased on the list of judges Donald Trump has said he would consider for nomination, our civil rights could be in real jeopardy with a Trump presidency. Multiple judges on Trump\\u2019s list have upheld the kind of discriminatory voter ID laws that Eaton is fighting in North Carolina. \\nFor instance, after a lower court found that Wisconsin\\u2019s voter ID law \\u201cresults in the denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race or color ,\\u201d Judge Diane Sykes\\u2014whom Trump has named as a possible Supreme Court nominee\\u2014nonetheless voted to reinstate the law. A Trump Supreme Court could uphold suppressive voting laws that have been shown to substantially lower turnout among minority voters. \\nIn other civil rights matters, the records of Trump\\u2019s proposed judges paint a similarly distressing picture. \\nIn a case involving a black worker being passed over for a promotion because of his race, Judge William Pryor argued that it was just a \\u201cconversational\\u201d aside when the supervisor in the case called an African American employee \\u201cboy,\\u201d dismissing the condescending slur as not connected to promotion decisions. Equally alarming is Judge Steven Colloton, also on Trump\\u2019s list, who would have refused to allow a woman who reported being sexually harassed and fired by her manager to go to trial. \\nCivil rights issues will continue to make their way to the Supreme Court time and again. I shudder to imagine the Supreme Court justices Trump has proposed serving as the final word on the legal questions that shape Americans\\u2019 access to the ballot box, housing, discrimination-free workplaces, and other critical civil rights. \\nThe fate of hard-won rights and liberties, like those Rosanell Eaton began fighting for more than 70 years ago, rests in the hands of the justices on that bench\\u2014and every vote counts. \\nDr. Mary Frances Berry is a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania and serves on the board of People For the American Way.
