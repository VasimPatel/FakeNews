"{\"title\": \"Three Quarters Of Americans Oppose Gun Control\", \"content\": \"Record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban \\nSteve   \\nA new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . \\nThe survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. \\nThe findings represent a four-point increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an all-time high for the past three decades. \\nThe poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are \\u201cagainst\\u201d a ban on semi-automatic rifles, or \\u201cassault weapons\\u201das the corporate media refers to them. \\nThat figure represents a full ten-point increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. \\nJust 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semi-automatic ban. an eight-point decline on previous findings. \\nIn addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. \\nIn a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a \\u201cparadox\\u201d: \\nPerhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. \\nThe findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clinton\\u2019s position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. \\nHillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. \\nClinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankrupt\\u2013and eventually end\\u2013gun manufacturing in the United States.
