Pat McCrory, Vanita Gupta, the top civil rights lawyer for the Justice Department, said that \\u201cboth you and the State of North Carolina\\u201d were in violation of civil rights law, and gave him until Monday to decide \\u201cwhether you will remedy these violations.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A Justice Department official said that federal officials hoped that the state would agree to comply voluntarily with federal civil rights law by abandoning the measure. But the department has a number of tools it can use to try to force compliance, including denying federal funds or asking a court to do so, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\\\",\\\"The ultimatum escalated a contentious national debate over North Carolina\\u2019s new legal stance on transgender and gay people, and set up what could be a lengthy showdown between the state and the Obama administration.\\\",\\\"In a statement, Mr. McCrory, a Republican, said: \\u201cThe right and expectation of privacy in one of the most private areas of our personal lives is now in jeopardy. We will be reviewing to determine the next steps.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Phil Berger, the president pro tempore of the State Senate, accused the Justice Department of \\u201ca gross overreach\\u201d that he said \\u201cdeserves to be struck down in federal court.\\u201d Tim Moore, the speaker of the House, called the letter an attempt to \\u201ccircumvent the will of the electorate and instead unilaterally exert its extreme agenda.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The state measure, House Bill 2, known as HB2, was signed into law in March and says the bathroom a person uses is determined by his or her biological gender at birth. That requirement \\u201cis facially discriminatory against transgender employees\\u201d because it treats them differently from other employees, Ms. Gupta wrote.\\\",\\\"As a result, \\u201cwe have concluded that in violation of Title VII, the state is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of Title VII right by employees of public agencies,\\u201d she said. The letter was first reported by The Charlotte Observer.\\\",\\\"The law has become an issue in the presidential campaign and has prompted boycotts of North Carolina from celebrities like Bruce Springsteen, as well as calls for repeal by a number of businesses, some of which have canceled plans to create new jobs in the state.\\\",\\\"Opponents cheered the Justice Department\\u2019s move.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think it makes clear what we\\u2019ve known all along, which is that HB2 is deeply discriminatory and violates civil rights law in all kinds of manners,\\u201d said State Representative Chris Sgro of Greensboro.\\\",\\\"Matt McTighe, executive director of Freedom for All Americans, an L.G.B.T. rights group, said in a statement Wednesday that \\u201cactions have consequences, and Governor McCrory and his legislative allies are now paying the price for this anti-transgender law that they so hurriedly enacted.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHB2 is a solution in a search of a problem that simply doesn\\u2019t exist, and lawmakers must take immediate action to fully repeal it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe state\\u2019s economy and reputation have suffered enough, and now students all across the state stand to lose out on nearly $1 billion in critical funding because of HB2. The livelihoods of North Carolina\\u2019s families are at stake, and there is no excuse for inaction.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In December 2014, the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr., directed the Justice Department to begin including gender identity \\u2014 including transgender status \\u2014 as a basis for discrimination claims under federal civil rights law.\\\",\\\"That decision reversed a policy at the Justice Department that specifically excluded transgender people from federal protection. Mr. Holder called the decision \\u201can important shift,\\u201d meant to affirm the Justice Department\\u2019s commitment \\u201cto protecting the civil rights of all Americans.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In addition, the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission held last year that \\u201cequal access to restrooms is a significant, basic condition of employment\\u201d and that denying access to transgender individuals was discriminatory, Ms. Gupta noted, in her letter to Mr. McCrory.\\\",\\\"The Justice Department\\u2019s threat was not the only front opened Wednesday in the battle over transgender bathroom rights.\\\",\\\"In Illinois, a group calling itself Students and Parents for Privacy filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education, the Justice Department, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the school directors of Township High School District 211 in Cook County, Ill., seeking to stop the district from \\u201cforcing 14- to 17-year-old girls to use locker rooms and restrooms with biological males.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In November, federal education authorities ruled that the school district, near Chicago, violated Title IX, the federal law that forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in public education, when it did not allow a transgender student who said she identifies as a girl to change and shower in the girls\\u2019 locker room without restrictions.\\\",\\\"The fact that the student, who is biologically male, now uses the bathroom and locker rooms at William Fremd High School, the lawsuit states, creates an \\u201cintimidating and hostile environment\\u201d for girls, according to the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in the United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois.\\\",\\\"The suit also asks the court to set aside a Department of Education rule in which transgender students are covered under Title IX.\\\",\\\"Meanwhile, in Oxford, Ala., the City Council on Wednesday rescinded an ordinance it had passed the week before that forbade people to use a public restroom that did not match their gender at birth, according to the Alabama news websiteal.com.\\\",\\\"The news service reported that at least one of the three members who voted to rescind the ordinance in the 3-2 vote was influenced by a city attorney\\u2019s opinion that the ordinance might be illegal under Title IX.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
