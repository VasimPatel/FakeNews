Average US inflation since 1995 has been steady at around 2.2%. But during that same period, cable TV prices have increased by 5.8% per year on average. The data comes from an FCC report on cable TV Pricing (pdf, hat tip cordcutting.com ) released last month, and notes that back in 1995, cable cost an average of just $22.35 a month. That has since ballooned to an average of $69.03, or a 208.9% jump. \\nObviously these constant hikes \\u2014 which often come twice or more a year for some cable customers \\u2014 have played a starring role in driving consumers to alternative streaming options. \\nAnd this annoyance has only grown as fights between cable broadcasters and cable companies have only accelerated. In fact, the FCC also recently found that return fees charged by broadcasters jumped as much as 63% in one year. Post navigation\", \"source_id\": 5735, \"article_id\": 320362}"
