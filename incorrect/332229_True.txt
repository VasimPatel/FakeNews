"{\"title\": \"How Clinton Campaign Gamed Super PAC Regulations\", \"content\": \"Memos prepared by legal counsel for Hillary Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign reveal how the campaign developed workarounds so it could coordinate with a network of pro-Clinton super political action committees or Super PACs. The memos were explicitly developed to ensure regulators at the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would not detect any signs of unethical practices.\\nWhile the workarounds may not necessarily be illegal as a result of the Supreme Court\\u2019s Citizens United decision, they clearly undermine campaign finance law, and for those concerned about the influence of money in politics, the policies developed show how candidates can easily game the system.\\nThe documents, produced by Marc Elias of Perkins Coie LLP, were attached to emails from the Clinton campaign, which were published by WikiLeaks. They were drafted on April 1, 2015, before Clinton officially launched her presidential campaign.\\nPerkins Coie recommended , \\u201cSecretary Clinton and her agents to make a hard solicitation for $5,000,\\u201d when discussing any Super PAC with prospective donors. Super PACs and their personnel would be free to \\u201cfollow up with the donor\\u2014that day or at any other time of their choosing \\u2013 to ask for additional funds, without any participation by Secretary Clinton or her agents.\\u201d\\nThe campaign also asked for a procedure that would permit Clinton and anyone working for her to \\u201cdiscuss Super PACs with prospective donors without making a solicitation for money.\\u201d But the law firm the campaign hired advised against this approach and noted there was a \\u201clegally prescribed way for the Secretary and her agents to attend Super PAC fundraising events.\\u201d\\nIn this \\u201calternative approach,\\u201d Clinton and \\u201cher agents\\u201d could appear at fundraising events and openly discuss the \\u201cpolitical objectives\\u201d of the Super PAC. Clinton and anyone representing the campaign would be \\u201cfeatured speakers\\u201d or \\u201cspecial guests.\\u201d They would not directly solicit contributions for the Super PAC. They would not publicize fundraising events.\\n\\u201cTo avoid any risk that the statement made by the Secretary or her agents would be construed as a solicitation, a notice should be prominently displayed at the entrance to the event or a card placed on every table,\\u201d Elias advised.\\nThe developed disclaimer read:\\nSolicitations by federal candidates and officeholders are limited by federal law. Any federal candidates or officeholders speaking tonight will not be soliciting donations, or will be soliciting only donations of up to $5000 from individuals and multi-candidate political committees. They will not be soliciting donations of any amount from corporations, labor organizations, foreign nationals, federal contractors, or national banks.\\nIn a separate memo, \\u201c Super PACs ,\\u201d Elias contended the mere fact that a disclaimer was displayed made it possible for Clinton to \\u201cmake a general request for funds without reference to any dollar amount or source.\\u201d\\n\\u201cWhile the Secretary does not have to repeat this disclaimer in one-on-one conversations with event guests, the Secretary may not encourage them to disregard the notice nor may the Secretary ever ask for contributions in excess of the applicable limit or from prohibited sources.\\u201d\\nThis way, if a donor who attended a fundraising event donated far more than $5,000, the act could not be directly connected to the remarks of Clinton, even though that fundraising event may have played a critical role in that donor\\u2019s decision to support Clinton substantially.\\nDespite the historical nature of meetings between potential donors and presidential candidates, Elias maintained the campaign could avoid scrutiny by insisting contributions were not expected as a \\u201ccondition\\u201d or \\u201cappropriate response\\u201d to the \\u201copportunity to meet with the Secretary or her agents for this political discussion.\\u201d\\nIt would be made clear there was no \\u201cexpectation whatsoever by the Secretary or her agents that the donor make a contribution of any amount to the PAC\\u201d or that the meeting was a \\u201cfundraising meeting organized to support the fundraising objectives of the PAC.\\u201d\\nThrough this arrangement, influential and wealthy people, with or without ties to corporations, might engage in the same actions that they would if Clinton directly solicited contributions at these fundraisers or meetings. The culture of electoral politics would lead such individuals to recognize these interactions as a means to convince them to make contributions. They know the sensitivity around making certain a candidate they support does not draw attention from regulators. But because Clinton did not say words, which explicitly represent a request for funds, this is supposed to be considered acceptable.\\nIn the \\u201cSuper PACs\\u201d memo, Elias contended Clinton and \\u201cher agents\\u201d will inevitably \\u201cfind themselves talking to prospective donors about Super PACs. The conversation might be initiated by the Secretary or her agents. Or, more likely, it might be initiated by the prospective donor.\\u201d\\n\\u201cCommon questions include, \\u2018Secretary, the Super PAC has asked for my support. Should I contribute?\\u201d or \\u2018I want to give a million dollars to support your campaign\\u2014to which organization should I write my check?\\u2019\\u201d Elias outlines. \\u201cThere will be hundreds of variants. In these types of interactions, it is not reasonable to expect the Secretary or her agents to make snap-determinations about whether their statements of political support for a Super PAC amount to a solicitation or direction of funds in the context of the particular conversation.\\u201d\\n\\u201cAccordingly, our strong recommendation is that the Secretary and her agents make a hard ask for $5,000 or less for the Super PAC in any conversation with a donor in which the Super PAC is discussed,\\u201d Elias adds.\\nThe memo further indicated, \\u201cThe Secretary and her agents should not tell donors that someone from the PAC will be following up with them and should not ask donors to take a call from PAC personnel. Nonetheless, it is permissible for the Secretary and her agents to provide donors with contact information of a PAC representative, so that the donors can execute the $5,000 contribution or learn more information about the PAC if they choose to do so.\\u201d\\nOr, if the donor contacted the PAC representative, the PAC would now be able to solicit much more than a $5,000 contribution, even though that donor may have never contacted the PAC if they had not been introduced to Clinton.\\nThe law firm additionally advised, \\u201cThe Secretary and her agents may suggest particular donors to Super PAC personnel. Specifically, the Secretary and her agents may provide the names, contact information, and donor history (if any) of potential donors.\\u201d\\n\\u201cA Super PAC soliciting funds outside of federal limits should not tell the donor that the Secretary or her agents provided the PAC with the donor\\u2019s name and contact information,\\u201d according to the memo.\\n\\u201cTo reduce the risk of impermissible coordination, it would be prudent for the Super PAC to place a firewall between its fundraising personnel and its \\u2018creative\\u2019 personnel (e.g. those involved in the creation, production, or distribution of communications and in the strategic discussions informing such communications),\\u201d Elias recommended. \\u201cAnd, likewise, the campaign ought to designate a handful of fundraising staff and consultants to liaise with the Super PAC\\u2019s fundraising personnel.\\u201d\\n\\u201cBeyond this small handful of fundraising staff, there is no need for the Secretary or her agents to interact with Super PAC personnel except for when they are appearing as \\u2018special guests\\u2019 at a Super PAC event.\\u201d\\nIt is all a rather elaborate scheme to ensure millions of dollars can be funneled into the coffers of a presidential campaign without having to be inhibited by campaign finance law supposedly in force to provide some regulation of the influence of money.\\nPerkins Coie explicitly set out to develop guidelines that would make it possible for individuals to wear \\u201ctwo hats,\\u201d as in raise money and also serve the campaign in some manner. However, Elias cautioned , \\u201cWe may decide that some of our fundraising agents are too risky\\u2014either because we don\\u2019t trust them to follow these guidelines or because we do not think it is credible that they are raising in a capacity other than as a campaign agent\\u2014and tell Priorities that they cannot use them to raise.\\u201d\\nAs previously reported by the Wall Street Journal, Elias sent a memo on interactions with the Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA, on April 21, 2015. The memo was attached to an email published by WikiLeaks. It instructed the campaign to make sure the Clinton campaign never explicitly asked Priorities USA to raise \\u201csoft money,\\u201d which the Sunlight Foundation describes as \\u201ccash contributed to a party, candidate, or outside group without being subject to limits.\\u201d\\nThe campaign could say, \\u201cDonor A works in financial services and has been a long-time contributor. I think she\\u2019d be willing to do six figures for Priorities,\\u201d but it could not say, \\u201cI want you to call Donor A and ask for $250,000.\\u201d\\nPriorities USA has raised over $175 million, according to the Sunlight Foundation, which is more than any Super PAC in history.\\nThe Clinton campaign has faced criticism for its coordination with David Brock\\u2019s Correct the Record Super PAC. Brock believes the Super PAC can legally coordinate with the campaign because all the content it produces is posted for free online and exempt from the FEC\\u2019s ban on \\u201ccoordinated communications.\\u201d\\nSunlight Foundation points out, \\u201cIts whole apparently legal existence depends on it not making independent expenditures, because it openly coordinates with the Clinton campaign, which is otherwise forbidden for a super PAC.\\u201d Nonetheless, there has been no action by the FEC to shut down this coordination.\\nThe FEC, according to the Washington Post, has yet to \\u201copen an investigation into alleged illegal super PAC coordination, closing 29 such complaints,\\u201d since 2010. Nevertheless, the campaign was concerned it may engage in activity that could spur an investigation if they were not careful and had Perkins Coie help them avoid any potential scandals.\\nThe New York Times reported , \\u201cDemocrats have built the largest and best-coordinated apparatus of outside groups operating in the 2016 presidential campaign,\\u201d and raised funds at a 2-to-1 rate when compared to Donald Trump.\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no question that we need to make Washington work much better than it does today,\\u201d Clinton said in June. \\u201cAnd that means, in particular, getting unaccountable money out of our politics.\\u201d She added, \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I\\u2019m so passionate about this issue, and I will fight hard to end the stranglehold that the wealthy and special interests have on so much of our government.\\u201d\\nClinton has openly supported overturning the Citizens United decision. However, she has accepted countless amounts of \\u201cunaccountable money\\u201d in the 2016 presidential election, and her campaign has pioneered new methods for circumventing regulations against super PAC coordination in order to bring more money into her campaign.\\nThe post How Clinton Campaign Gamed Super PAC Regulations appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n\", \"source_id\": 17674, \"article_id\": 332229}"
