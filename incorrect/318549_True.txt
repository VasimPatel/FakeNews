We were so loaded for every possible eventuality. We had so many guests. We had so many pre-taped pieces, all based on a different eventuality. We had three shows: Hillary Clinton wins and we know; Hillary Clinton wins and we don\\u2019t know, because it\\u2019s not called before the show\\u2019s over; Donald Trump's going to win and we don\\u2019t know, because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory. That's not wishful thinking, that's what everyone was saying. \\nAnd then there was the last show, which is the show we did, which is Donald Trump is going to win and we know he's going to win. My execs and my writers were like, \\u201cYou don't want to write something for that?\\u201d and I'm like, \\u201cNo! There is nothing you can write. You don't understand. I have 400 people in my theater. If we know Donald Trump is going to win, it's going to be like doing stand-up comedy for one of those Chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives. There will be no laughter!\\u201d We only did about 20 minutes of material before we went, \\u201cF\\u2014 it, it's going to be him, let's just talk for another hour.\\u201d So I think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night. \\nColbert moaned that the special was \\\"the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,\\\" adding, \\\"I was tying my tie at 10:30 and I went, 'Oh, he took Ohio. Oh, well, we expected that. He took it by 11 points. Wow! That's not expected.' And then over my guests' shoulders, people kept holding up signs that said, 'Florida, Iowa, Nebraska.'\\\" He revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared, but \\\"none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned. Our audience was sobbing openly. And those are people who work for me, like my cameramen.\\\" \\nAs Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro pointed out years ago , Colbert's manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives: \\nHe engages in Conservativeface. He needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative \\u2013 after all, conservatives come in every shape and size. Instead, he acts as though he is a conservative \\u2013 an idiotic, racist, sexist, bigoted, brutal conservative. He out-Archie Bunkers Archie Bunker. His audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious \\u201cColbert\\u201d who wishes to persecute gays; they chortle at evil sexist \\u201cColbert\\u201d who thinks men are victims of sexism. This is the purpose of Colbert\\u2019s routine. His show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks. In order to justify their racism, racists had to create a false perception of blacks; in the same way, Colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives. \\nOn Saturday night, Colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a Trump presidency, arguing, \\\"I\\u2019m all for giving him a chance, but don\\u2019t give him an inch. Because I believed everything he said, and I remember everything he said. And it\\u2019s horrifying. It's possible. The job changes a man. That's the cliche of the presidency.\\\" He pontificated: \\nEvery president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say, \\u201cWell, there are levers of power in Washington that can slow him down.\\u201d But two things: One is they're cowards. Second is that the levers in Washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull. Because they tried to stop Trump. Everybody tried to stop Trump, do not delude yourself. \\nEveryone except the people he's going to appoint tried to stop him and they didn't. He owes them nothing. He goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd, \\u201cShall I do it?\\u201d And they say, '\\u201dYes.\\u201d And he says, \\u201cIt shall be so.\\u201d And the balcony is Twitter. He goes onto Twitter and he goes, \\u201cWhat do you think? Do you think I'm right?\\u201d That's what scares me, that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn't. And he's a vindictive person. So it's all going to be fine. Merry Christmas. \\u201cNo! There is nothing you can write.\\\" Stephen Colbert \\nColbert concluded, \\\"The next person who says to me, 'You must be happy on a certain level,\\u2019 is going to have their eye carved out.\\u201d \\nSo that\\u2019s the man underneath the comedy mask . . .\", \"source_id\": 3931, \"article_id\": 318549}"
