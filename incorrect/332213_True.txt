"{\"title\": \"This Guy Got Destroyed By the System\", \"content\": \"by Simon Black, Sovereign Man : \\nMy friend Richard got destroyed by the system. \\nAs a financial advisor in Sacramento, California, he spent years building a thriving firm and has even landed a few celebrity clients. \\nRichard did well for himself. Successful. Married. Wonderful kids. Financially secure. \\nBut back in 2008 things started to turn sour. \\nHis wife left him and took the kids, along with half of everything else. \\nThe divorce forced the liquidation of many of their assets, including a substantial investment portfolio he had built up. \\nRichard didn\\u2019t want to sell; by the time the divorce was being fought, it was 2009 and the stock market had crashed. \\nBut Richard had no choice. They liquidated and suffered major losses. \\nMost painfully, since Richard\\u2019s business was so successful, the judge ordered him to pay alimony of nearly $20,000 per month. \\nIt didn\\u2019t matter that, practically overnight, most of his new business had dried up due to the Great Recession. \\nThus began the long indentured servitude known as alimony. \\nThe idea behind alimony is to make sure that the ex-spouse can maintain a comfortable standard of living while s/he gets rebuilds a life and financial base. \\nIt shouldn\\u2019t be abused as a lottery ticket. \\nIn Richard\\u2019s case, it\\u2019s been 7+ long years and nearly $2 million in alimony paid. But the payments never stop. \\nEven though the kids are now grown and out of the house, his ex-wife has zero incentive to go out and find a job to support herself. \\nWhy would she bother working hard when she can do nothing and collect $20k from her ex-husband? \\nYet due to the length of time they were married, and California\\u2019s ridiculous legal code, there\\u2019s no end in sight for Richard\\u2019s alimony payments. \\nSo Richard has the government taking 50% (between federal and state income tax) from his left pocket, and his wife taking nearly a quarter of a million dollars per year out of his right pocket. \\nNaturally if he stops paying either one of them he\\u2019ll face the long arm of the law. \\nSpeaking of the law, the Dodd-Frank Act that was passed several years ago to reform the financial system totally crippled his business. \\nIt\\u2019s one of the costliest and most painful regulations ever created for financial services businesses, and Richard constantly has regulators breathing down his neck. \\nIt\\u2019s amazing. Despite taking half of his income, the government makes it increasingly difficult for Richard to produce. \\nRichard turned 50 this year, and he was miserable. \\nInstead of slowing down and enjoying life, he\\u2019d been working harder than ever to earn less than ever, with very little time left over to build a personal life for himself. \\nHis problems also started to manifest in other ways. He\\u2019d gained weight, and was drinking more, and I doubt he\\u2019d gone on a date since 2013. \\nSadly, Richard is not an isolated case. There are countless people across the country who have been destroyed by the system. \\nHe came to me for help earlier this year, which I was more than happy to extend. \\nInitially we established a new financial advisory business for Richard in a more favorable jurisdiction. \\nThat jurisdiction was Puerto Rico. \\nUnder Puerto Rico\\u2019s generous incentive laws, Richard\\u2019s new firm is able to provide financial services for worldwide clients without the pain of onshore US regulations. \\nIt\\u2019s made things much easier for him so that he can focus on servicing his clients\\u2019 needs and winning new business, as opposed to filling out forms and pleasuring regulators. \\nThe new firm is growing rapidly as a result. And best of all, his Puerto Rico profits are taxed at just 4%, instead of the 50% he was paying in California. \\nRichard still has the California business. And to reduce the taxes there, my advisors set him up with something called a \\u201cCaptive Insurance Company\\u201d. \\nThis one is a real goldmine.\", \"source_id\": 17660, \"article_id\": 332213}"
