We have to apply more pressure,\\\" another one added. \\nMeanwhile, large numbers of pro-government protesters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace in a show of support for Maduro. \\nAs the protests were being held, the president engaged in crisis security talks in reaction to the demonstrators\\u2019 demands. In a televised speech after the talks, he called for \\\"political dialogue and peace in Venezuela.\\\" This handout picture released by the Venezuelan Presidency shows Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro delivering a speech to supporters during a gathering in Caracas on October 26, 2016.

Back then, four state courts said the signature-gathering process for the referendum had been \\u201cfraudulent,\\u201d effectively blocking it.
