"{\"content\": \"From Roanoke.com : \\nGetachew Fekede, 53, a former employee at FreightCar America, shot three workers \\u2014 one fatally \\u2014 and grazed a fourth before killing himself, Roanoke police have said. \\nAll of the victims were found close to each other, police said. Daniel Wesley Brown, 56, of Montvale, died at the scene. Keith Dwayne Law, 31, of Rocky Mount and Gary David Koran, 32, of Roanoke remain hospitalized at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where they were listed in fair condition as of Wednesday morning, according to a hospital spokesman. \\nValderrama, 31, of Catawba was released from the hospital Tuesday. He\\u2019s a welder at FreightCar America, where he\\u2019s worked for three and a half years. \\nBrown, who was from New York, was a 14-year U.S. Army veteran who served as an engineer during Desert Storm in a non-combat role, said his girlfriend, Vickie Hawkins. He worked at FreightCar America for eight years, most recently as a fitter. She said he knew who Fekede was but never talked about him. \\n\\u201cHe liked his job,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe liked the people he worked with. From what I gather, he didn\\u2019t seem to have any issues with anybody there.\\u201d \\nEmployees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from the company, said they were shocked that anyone would hurt Brown. One man who worked at FreightCar America with Brown said he said \\u201chad a really good heart.\\u201d \\n\\u201cDaniel always had a lot to say and he was never shy about telling you how he felt or what he thought, even if it wasn\\u2019t complimentary,\\u201d the man said. \\nAnother employee said he couldn\\u2019t imagine that someone would want to target Brown. \\n\\u201cIt had to be a stray bullet, because there\\u2019s no way anyone could have ill will towards him,\\u201d he said. \\nPolice are still investigating whether Fekede targeted the victims and are determining a possible motive for the shooting, although Jones said it was likely work-related. Information about where Fekede got the gun has not been released by police, who said he fired 10 rounds from a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun. \\nFekede\\u2019s neighbors at Brandon Manor Apartments near Towers Shopping Center have described him as friendly and generous and said he was often working. A few neighbors noted that he spoke about another employee \\u201cmessing with him,\\u201d a problem that he said he\\u2019d raised with the human resources department at the company. \\n\\u2026 Fekede came to Roanoke in 2011 through a refugee program, police have said. Hannah Whitt, a 23-year-old Roanoke resident, said she helped resettle him while interning with Commonwealth Catholic Charities. The agency has not responded to requests for comment about whether it had contact with Fekede. \\nWhitt said Fekede lived in a house on Moorman Avenue with three other men. They were from Ethiopia but had been staying in the Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya, she said. None of the men had family in the U.S. when they moved to Roanoke, Whitt said. \\nWe gave this \\u201crefugee\\u201d asylum and a job in our country and this is how he repays us. \\nHillary Clinton wants to bring in hundreds of thousands more just like him. \\nCourtesy of Information Liberation Don't forget to follow the D.C.
