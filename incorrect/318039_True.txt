It has kept the teen confined to a wheelchair for the past 10 years. \\nDespite the inability to stand on his own , the boy has always been patriotic, his mother said, standing in his own manner whenever he sees the flag or hears the national anthem or Pledge of Allegiance. The teen even owns a number of pairs of leg braces emblazoned with a stars-and-stripes motif.   \\nThe picture of young Trenholm standing as his school\\u2019s Junior ROTC color guard marched past was snapped by his uncle, Myron Leggett, a professional photographer. \\n\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t have to do that. He has an excuse to stay seated,\\u201d said Leggett. \\u201cNobody told him, nobody encouraged him and he did it on his own. I admire him for that and I\\u2019m very proud of him.\\u201d \\nThe subsequent posting of the picture to social media brought a vast amount of attention, earning thousands of likes, comments and shares, even from national media outlets. \\nThis should serve as an inspiration to all those who are tired of seeing the flag and anthem and country they represent being disrespected by individuals pushing a divisive agenda.  \", \"article_id\": 318039}"
