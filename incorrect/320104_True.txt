"{\"content\": \"Kp Message 10-27-16\\u2026 \\u201cPassage through the Storm Waters\\u201d \\nAlthough I often post here a variety of \\u201cnews type\\u201d things here, there\\u2019s so much that I have no understanding of, and perhaps never will. I feel I do not belong to the outer \\u201ccrap appearances\\u201d, or the things that are seemingly so \\u201cout of whack\\u201d with the Light of us all. And I also am not aligned with the idea that \\u201cI am responsible for (and caused) it all.\\u201d Sorry\\u2026 no. \\nThis particular time upon this planet often feels like we are dealing with \\u201cthe storm waters\\u201d\\u2026 winds blowing one way, then another way, waves coming from one direction, then another direction, and who knows what is going on with the political waves. Enough already. \\nBut as I\\u2019ve learned by bodysurfing at Sandy Beach, on a strong trades swell day, it is possible to flow with the rapid changing waves, and even catch a few, kick out, and get ready for the next one(s). And truly enjoy the experience of the \\u201cgoing with the flow\\u201d. We all have tools, and we all can find our place in this time of massive transformation. \\nAlso I remember that even though there is this massive transformation going on, this is simply a passage\\u2026 we\\u2019re passing through. We will not be living in \\u201cthe Storm Waters\\u201d every moment. \\nThere\\u2019s nothing wrong with not being able to relate to this, but some can sense what\\u2019s happening, and it is quite big. \\nSo we\\u2019ll see where it all goes. In the end, BEing and SHINING our Lights, whatever they are, is perhaps the most valuable thing we can do to pass through those \\u201cStormy Waters\\u201d. \\nAloha, Kp\", \"source_id\": 5508, \"title\": \"Kp Message 10-27-16\\u2026 \\u201cPassage through the Storm Waters\\u201d\", \"article_id\": 320104}"
