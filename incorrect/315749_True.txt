"{\"content\": \"(Before It's News)\\nby Leon Pantenburg\\nI bought this knife to review. At the time of publication, Kellem Knives had no sponsorship relationship with Survivalcommonsense.com. I\\u2019m a sucker for old time knife designs, especially when they are re-created with modern materials. IMO, this makes for a time-tested, utility design that will do the job.\\nI particularly like the Scandinavian Puukko design, so that\\u2019s why I got a Kellam Hawk.\\nThe Kellam Hawk\\nThe puukko is a Finnish knife, and the name lends itself to the Finnish word \\u201cpuukotta,\\u201d which means \\u201cto stab/knife.\\u201d The prefix, \\u201cpuu\\u201d means \\u201cwood\\u201d in Finnish. The design of the puukko is attributed to the indigenous Sami people, who created several knives to use for day to day tasks; the puukko was the smaller option, used to skin fish or animals.\\n\\u201cAlthough historical records vary, the puukko dates back about 1000 years. Both men and women carried (and carry) puukkos, although the sizes change depending on the person, as the puukko handle is meant to fit the hand size of the user. (From: EDC History: Pukko \\u2013 A simple knife with a rich history.)\\nThe old design is getting some attention from modern knifemakers. I recently reviewed the Battle Horse Knives Feather Stick, another knife with the Puukko design, and it worked out really well.\\nHere\\u2019s the Hawk\\u2019s specs:\\nProduct Details:\\nBlade: 3\\u2033 Carbon Steel Handle: 4.5\\u2033 Stained Curly Birch Full Tang construction Dangler-style leather sheath Total Length : 7.5\\u2033 Grind: Convex is my all-time, go-to favorite grind , but scandi is a close second or third. For a beginner, it is the easiest to learn to sharpen on. The bevel is sharpening guide \\u2013 all you do is lay it flat on a whetstone and hone away.\\nThe scandi is also a great woodworking grind, and a practical choice for someone looking for a bushcraft knife.\\nThe Hawk handle fits my large hands very well.\\nHandle: I have big hands \\u2013 size large gloves \\u2013 and many otherwise excellent knives don\\u2019t work for me because the handle is too short. I don\\u2019t like two or three finger grips. IMO, they don\\u2019t give a secure grip for hard work, and I\\u2019m concerned they might twist in my hand.\\nThe 4.5-inch handle fits my hand really, really well. It is made of dyed curly birch, a common wood in Russia and Scandinavia, with nice figure. The wood makes a handle that doesn\\u2019t transfer heat or cold. This is a consideration for a knife that will be used in Finland\\u2019s frigid winter.\\nThe diameter is large, which gives me a good, solid grip. When wet or slimy from cleaning fish, or bloody from butchering, the handle seems to get \\u201cgrippier.\\u201d\\nA comfortable, safe handle is a really important aspect of a user knife. Pretty doesn\\u2019t cut it (pun intended) when there are lengthy cutting tasks to be done.\\nSteel: The high carbon steel holds a wicked edge. I don\\u2019t know exactly what it is, but the Hawk\\u2019s steel held up nicely to normal cutting and bushcraft tasks.\\nTraditionally, Blade materials can vary from the three-layer approach, which combines strong and flexible steels, to composite designs. Most are made with Finnish steel, Ovako 100Cr6, which is equivalent to U.S 52100 bearing steel, according to Nordic knife blog Nordiska Kniva r.\\nSpine: I would like the spine to be ground at a 90-degree angle, like an ice skate, so it could be used for processing tinder or scraping a ferro rod. It isn\\u2019t. But a few passes on a grinder could fix that.\\nSheath: The dangler-style, form-fitted leather sheath holds the knife securely. Almost too securely. It requires a slight twist to loosen the Hawk. It\\u2019s a consideration \\u2013 the knife won\\u2019t fall out, but it\\u2019s a two-hand job to remove it. This might be a deal-breaker for some users.\\nI find this annoying, but you can get used to the tight sheath.\\nFull tang construction with a brass bolster. I prefer a full tang on any rigid blade knife, even though I\\u2019ve never needed that extra strength. In fact, one of my favorite user knives, the Mora 840 Companion , has a plastic handle and a three-quarter tang.\\nFor the strongest knife available, though, get a full tang.\\nHand made in Finland.\\nThe Hawk is a user knife, able to handle a variety of tasks.\\nIn actual use , the Hawk lives up to the user reputation of the Puukko knives. It went along on Fremont District\\u2019s Webelos Woods, a Boy Scout outing, recently. It was used to whittle sticks and do the assorted tasks associated with camping.\\nOn the way home, on an isolated section of highway, I saw a fast-moving car hit a deer up ahead of me. The front end of the vehicle was demolished, and the hood popped. The air bag deployed and the radiator was steaming.\\nAfter checking out the driver and passenger for injuries, (they were shaken, but fine) the driver and I followed the injured buck. It had dragged itself across the road and was severely injured.\\nIt was still alive, with two broken legs, probable internal injuries and it was in agonizing pain. We called 911. Rather than wait a possible half-hour for the Oregon State Police to arrive, we ended the deer\\u2019s suffering with the only tool available \\u2013 the Kellam Hawk.\\nThe knife worked quickly and humanely for the sad, but necessary task.\\nThat\\u2019s the mark of a good knife. It gets the job done.\\nDo you need a Hawk?\\nEverybody needs a good knife . The Hawk is based on a proven design, with quality materials. The Hawk has proven to be a very useful tool, and one that can be used in a variety of situations, from slicing a bagel at work, to hunting and fishing.\\nThe knife retails for $74.95, and that\\u2019s a steal for a handmade knife. If you\\u2019re looking for a good-looking user, that you can work hard and pass down to your grandchildren, the Hawk is a really good choice.\\nPlease click here to check out and subscribe to the SurvivalCommonSense.com YouTube channel, and here to subscribe to our weekly email update \\u2013 thanks!\", \"article_id\": 315749, \"title\": \"Knife Review: Kellam Hawk Is Traditional Puukko Design with Modern Materials | Survival\", \"source_id\": 1187}"
