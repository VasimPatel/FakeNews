One: The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far\\u2026 Several offices separately have been doing their own investigations. \\nTwo: The immunity deal that Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, two top aides to Hillary Clinton, got from the Justice Department in which it was beleived that the laptops they had, after a narrow review for classified materials, were going to be destroyed. We have been told that those have not been destroyed \\u2014 they are at the FBI field office here on Washington and are being exploited. . \\nThree: The Clinton Foundation investigation is so expansive, they have interviewed and re-interviewed many people. They described the evidence they have as \\u2018a lot of it\\u2019 and said there is an \\u2018avalanche coming in every day.\\u2019 WikiLeaks and the new emails. \\nThey are \\u201cactively and aggressively pursuing this case.\\u201d Remember the Foundation case is about accusations of pay-for-play\\u2026 They are taking the new information and some of them are going back to interview people for the third time. As opposed to what has been written about the Clinton Foundation investigation, it is expansive. \\nThe classified e-mail investigation is being run by the National Security division of the FBI. They are currently combing through Anthony Weiner\\u2019s laptop. They are having some success \\u2014 finding what they believe to be new emaisls, not duplicates, that have been transported through Hillary Clinton\\u2019s server. \\nFinally, we learned there is a confidence from these sources that her server had been hacked. And that it was a 99% accuracy that it had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that things had been taken from that\\u2026 \\nThere has been some angst about Attorney General Loretta Lynch \\u2014 what she has done or not done. She obviously did not impanel, or go to a grand jury at the beginning. They also have a problem, these sources do, with what President Obama said today and back in October of 2015\\u2026 \\nI pressed again and again on this very issue\\u2026 The investigations will continue, there is a lot of evidence. And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they will continue to likely an indictment. \\nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.
