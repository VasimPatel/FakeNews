"{\"content\": \"[Graphic: Clinton vs Trump by DonkeyHotey .] Paul Jay interviews Henry A. Giroux Editor's Note The idea here that there politics is theater is not new; however, \\u201cpolitical theater\\u201d has never taken on the connotations that embrace what this campaign has revealed. It is clear that there has been an agreement about what \\u201cstory\\u201d is being played out, but that has gotten repeatedly derailed by two (now 3) sources of counter-story. One source, as noted in the following interview, are the wikileak materials. Another source has been Trump himself. While he may not understand politics, he is very adept with theater and controlling the media, and he has played them like a piano. Throughout this endless campaign I kept remembering \\u201cthere is no such thing as bad press.\\u201d Trump has certainly proved the truth of that adage repeatedly. The third source is James Comey. His repeated breaching of judicial-political norms will likely reverberate well after November 8th.\\nMentioned within this interview is the phenomenon of Americans seeming inability to maintain a long term memory. I believe this is a rich area to examine though this is not the focus of this discussion. Most people in the U.S. seem to live in the cultural equivalent of anteretrograde amnesia and lack the ability to make long term memories that extend beyond themselves. They remember their own histories, but their social memory is constantly being rewritten and little if anything seems to stick. Transcript PAUL JAY, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. I\\u0092m Paul Jay in Baltimore. I\\u0092m known for a documentary I made called Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows. It was about professional wrestling and a battle between Bret Hart and Vince McMann and we got a lot of behind the scenes coverage in that and I got to know the wrestling world some. It occurred to me that there\\u0092s a certain kind of press that covers wrestling much the way a lot of press covers American politics. Now everyone that has any sense about them at all knows that professional wrestling is theater. In fact, the film I made helped kind of make that clear for everyone. But it is theater and everyone acknowledges it\\u0092s theater but there is still some press out there that plays along and covers the wrestling theater as if it\\u0092s real. Well I think much the same thing goes on in American politics. Much of the election campaigns are positioning, rhetoric, language, supposedly support this, oppose that, which is really all part of the theater. But because it does affect the horse race of the outcome of the elections, most of the corporate media covers all of this theater as if it\\u0092s real. Well something\\u0092s happening in this election which because of partly the bluster and in some ways weird honesty of Donald Trump, some of that theater is breaking down. The WikiLeaks about Hillary Clinton and behind the scenes machinations of the Clinton campaign, there\\u0092s been somewhat of a tear in the fabric of this theater. Now joining us to talk about this is Henry Giroux. Henry joins us from Hamilton, Ontario. He\\u0092s a professor of scholarship in the public interest at McMaster University and author of his most recent book, America at war with itself. Thanks for joining us Henry. HENRY GIROUX: It\\u0092s a pleasure to be with you. JAY: So, what do you make of the idea that wrestling and American politics have a lot in common? GIROUX: I think it\\u0092s a fabulous analogy. I think that in many ways what we see happening is the cultural celebrity which has never really been taken too seriously, although it confers a great deal of authority, has all of a sudden outed itself. It\\u0092s out of the closet. I mean people realize that what we\\u0092re getting is not only an exercise in performance and showmanship but we\\u0092re also getting what I would call, an elimination of the truth. The truth is one of the great causalities of this particular election cycle. It\\u0092s never been more visible than it is now. In one hand, what you have basically a celebrity who has no trouble lying because he believes that nobody will really take him too seriously because he thinks he really is a celebrity. On the other hand, you have the alternative press, you have the alternative media exposing all the nonsense that of course Hillary Clinton believes in and making it clear that she has no lock on honesty either. It seems to me that as the truth begins to disappear, questions are being raised about what are the conditions that produced this. What are the contradictions at work here? What does it mean for instance when Hillary Clinton says she believes in families and she believes in children and she worked for the Children\\u0092s Defense Fund when in actuality as the first lady, she had no trouble calling black youth super predators, she basically supported her husband\\u0092s welfare program which did horrible things for pro minorities? She supported an educational system in part that had nothing to do with the imagination and real learning. Had everything to do with accountability and standardization. So, it goes on and on. I think that as this fabric gets torn, as the veil gets sort of taken away and as the mystic of theater begins to dissolve, a kind of shocking reality emerges. One steeped in corruption, despair, inequality, poverty, systemic violence, racism, that becomes increasing difficult for the American political, financial, and corporate elite to basically legitimize. JAY: I think the Clinton campaign\\u0092s particularly interesting. First of all, you have a 74 senator from Vermont. If he\\u0092d had maybe another month or two, might\\u0092 have actually might have won in terms of especially in his weakness in the south and amongst African Americans. Another month or two and he might have sorted some of that out. It\\u0092s quite remarkable that someone at least in terms of mainstream media, someone who came from obscurity, I think people that followed progressive politics, he was certainly well known. But for most of the country, they barely knew his name. To go from there to almost winning and there\\u0092s some suggestion, some of the specific state races he certainly didn\\u0092t lose fairly. Now you have the majority of the country simply says they don\\u0092t believe Hillary Clinton is a truth teller. They think she\\u0092s a liar. They don\\u0092t trust her. Yet she\\u0092s the only candidate these elites got. Trump lies exposed. Even the republicans, the fact that the system couldn\\u0092\\u2019t come up with better candidates within the republican party to actually take on someone like Trump that should\\u0092ve been an easy duck to shoot of anybody of any caliber. The whole caliber of these political candidates has just banal. GIROUX: I think what\\u0092s interesting here is that the republican party, they couldn\\u0092t come up with a decent candidate because they had no sense of the degree to which they had violated any principles that sort of [attaches] them to any notion of civic justice or to the economic issues that have caused enormous anger throughout the country, that they were unwilling to address. I think there\\u0092s another issue here. I think the issue is something you mentioned earlier about Bernie Sanders, who I find very hopeful, in that people don\\u0092t realize that language matters and I think what Bernie did, taking off from the Occupied movement which gave us a new language about inequality. Bernie gave us a language for economic and social justice and political justice in a way that we haven\\u0092t heard before because it was endlessly being replayed over and over again. I think that what you have there is you have the power of what I call a reimagination machine that attacks a disimagination machine. He took the disimagination machine which covers everything over in lies and false metaphors and indecent stories and corruption and he exposed them and I think that one of the great beginnings, one of the great movements for any form of insurrection of democracy is to make power visible. I think he did that. I think the black lives matter movement does that. I think they\\u0092re all driving liberals absolutely crazy because it\\u0092s becoming increasingly difficult for the liberals to basically defend this thing that they call democracy. It\\u0092s not a democracy at all. They know it. But they don\\u2019\\u0092t have a language to basically come back at this. I know. I was listening to a radio this morning and I don\\u2019\\u0092t know if you know this but the alt-right, they\\u2019\\u0092re responding to this by intimidating people, by attempting to ruin the lives of now I think it\\u0092s like 500 reporters throughout the United States attacking their families, putting stuff on twitter, putting pictures of their children up in ways that are utterly disgusting and vile. I think you see two moments here. You see a moment of impending fascism which is utterly violent and criminogenic. Then you see another moment which is criminogenic but not as violent. But\\u0092 its grappling at the same time with some way to rescue itself by pointing only to Trump without at the same time pointing to its own liabilities. JAY: I think the sort of mediocrity banality of these candidates, it\\u0092s not just a happen chance, and many of the presidents in the past and I would put both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \\u2013 they\\u0092re smart guys. I disagree with probably 98 or 99% of their policies and both of them were involved in what I think could be categorized as war crimes, including Bill Clinton and sanctions on Iraq and the drone policy and others and the development of the war on Syria with Obama and such and Libya of course. But that being said, these are smart guys. They speak in full paragraphs. They are articulate. They can crack jokes. They\\u0092re knowledgeable. But it was under their watch that we had a great leap in this transfer of wealth to the top 1 or so percentile. A great leap in the parasitism of capital. Casino capitalism. Massive derivatives and speculative markets and this very parasitical, very degenerate you could say type of capital created this orgy of profits for this top tier at a level they\\u0092d never seen before and when you live in the bubble of those massive profits, perhaps they have no idea what\\u0092s going on amongst the American people. So, all of a sudden they get this shock in the republican party and almost a major shock in the democratic party and I don\\u0092t know if they really come back from this because I don\\u0092t know if they can really get out of this bubble disconnect with what\\u0092s going on in terms of daily life. GIROUX: They meaning the financial elite. Is that what you\\u0092re saying? JAY: Well the financial and political elites, yea. GIROUX: Exactly. Well I don\\u0092t want to underestimate the power of the cultural apparatuses that they control to basically normalize what appears to be unimaginable. I mean I\\u0092m always shocked by that I think the real issue here is that we live in a country in which memory is very short. We live in a culture of the immediate. I\\u0092m often shocked about what gets forgotten 5 days after the news cycle. So, the real question is, how do you keep the count of memories. These images. How do you keep this language up? This critical language that consistently reminds people of the contradictions and the crimes. The United States is a war culture. I mean there\\u0092\\u2019s no other way to talk about it. It\\u0092s primarily organized for the production of violence at almost every level. Of course, the punishing state is getting worse and the acceleration of police violence is getting worse. I think as long as the alternative media can focus on and sustain these images and these stories and these counter narratives, I think they\\u0092re fine. But it\\u0092s a hard fight because as you well know Paul the mainstream media controls most of the media and so the real question here is how do we take the question of culture and power and education and link it to everyday life in ways that allow it to travel across a variety of public spheres so that these memories and injustice and corruption can be sustained? JAY: Thanks very much for joining us Henry. GIROUX: My pleasure. JAY: And thank you for joining us on the Real News Network. \\nHenry A.
