"{\"title\": \"Obamacare Architect Asked How to 'Fix' the Program. His Answer Reinforces Critics' Worst Fears.\", \"content\": \"Share on Twitter \\nWith premiums set to spike dramatically in 2017, MIT economist and so-called Obamacare \\u201carchitect\\u201d Jonathan Gruber shared his big idea to fix the struggling health care law during an interview on CNN Wednesday. \\n\\u201cOnce again, there\\u2019s no sense in which this has to be fixed. The law is working as designed, however it could work better,\\u201d Gruber said. \\u201cI think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty.\\u201d \\nSo Gruber\\u2019s idea is to make it more expensive for people choosing to incur the \\u201cmandate penalty\\u201d in order to nudge them to enroll in Obamacare and take on higher premiums. The theory is that as more people enroll, the associated costs will go down. \\nYou might remember Gruber from a 2014 video in which he bragged about the Obama administration was able to take advantage of the \\u201cstupidity of the American voter\\u201d to get Obamacare passed. \\n\\u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage,\\u201d he said in the video. \\u201cCall it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to get anything to pass.\\u201d \\nOn several occasions, Gruber has been captured on video talking about exploiting American voters \\u201clack of economic understanding.\\u201d \\nThe Obama administration admitted on Monday that Obamacare premiums for mid-level benchmark plans will increase by 25 percent on average across the country. Further, 20 percent of consumers will also have just one insurer to select from. \\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump has vowed to \\u201crepeal and replace\\u201d Obamacare with a new plan to provide \\u201dgreat health care at a fraction of the cost.\\u201d He has offered few details on what that plan would entail. \\nHillary Clinton has promised to build on Obamacare and enact fixes rather than trashing the entire program. \", \"source_id\": 6420, \"article_id\": 320985}"
