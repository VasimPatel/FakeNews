Christian Today In a surprising revelation, Abedini said the Republican presidential nominee helped provide for the needs of his family in Boise, Idaho while he was locked up in an Iranian prison for his faith. The pastor said Trump gave his family $10,000 while he was imprisoned for three and a half years. \\u201cI am finally free in a free country. Last year on the same day I was sick and in chains for Christ, and now I can vote to choose my next president,\\u201d Abedini said in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday. \\u201cAnd most amazingly, I can vote for someone that I know fought for me and called my name so many times. He met my family and gave them a $10,000 gift. I think his ideas are more biblical than the other candidates,\\u201d he added. In contrast, Abedini said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did not do or say anything to help secure his release from Iranian prison. The pastor said Clinton never spoke his name or met his family. Abedini family As a woman who says she stands for women\\u2019s rights when she was foreign minister, she never contacted my mom, wife, sister or my daughter. She never did anything to help when I was in prison as an American pastor who was detained in Iran as a hostage,\\u201d he wrote. (Probably because she was too busy figuring out how to get more Iranian Muslims into the country) Last week, Abedini said he already cast an early vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\", \"source_id\": 1087, \"article_id\": 315658}"
