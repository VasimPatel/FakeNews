"{\"title\": \"BREAKING: Donald Trump Says He\\u2019s Going to Deport Up To 3 Million Immigrants Immediately\", \"content\": \"President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants with criminal records from the country immediately \\u2013 and has insisted that he will build his wall. \\nVia AlternativeNews \\n\\nIn his first extensive interview since he won the White House, Trump is reassuring his supporters that he will deport or incarcerate up to three million \\u2018gang members\\u2019 and \\u2018drug dealers.\\u2019\\nIn an interview with CBS\\u2019s 60 Minutes that airs on Sunday evening \\u2013 his first since winning the election \\u2013 Trump insisted that he will build the wall along the US-Mexico border that was a vital part of his presidential campaign.\\n\\u201cWhat we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two million \\u2013 it could be even three million \\u2013 we are getting them out of the country or we are going to incarcerate,\\u201d Mr Trump told 60 Minutes. \\u201cBe we\\u2019re getting them out of the country, they\\u2019re here illegally.\\u201d\\nHe explained that once the border is \\u201csecure\\u201d, then the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement will assess the status of the remaining undocumented immigrants in the country.\\n\\u201cAfter the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that they\\u2019re talking about who are terrific people, they\\u2019re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut before we make that determination\\u2026 it\\u2019s very important, we are going to secure our border.\\u201d When asked if he actually intends to build the wall along the southern border, Mr Trump simply replied, \\u201cYes.\\u201d However, Mr Trump explained that the wall along the 1,900 mile border would probably not be as grandiose as he promised \\u2013 describing an iteration of the boundary between the two countries that essentially already exists. \\u201cThere could be some fencing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFor certain areas I would [accept a fence], but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I\\u2019m very good at this, it\\u2019s called construction.\\u201d\\nThe President-elect\\u2019s comments about mass deportations stand at odds with a statement made by Paul Ryan, the highest ranking Republican, on Sunday morning. \\u201cWe are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump\\u2019s not planning on that,\\u201d Mr Ryan told CNN. \\u201cI think we should put people\\u2019s minds at ease: That is not what our focus is. That is not what we\\u2019re focused on. We\\u2019re focused on securing the border,\\u201d he added. \\u201cWe think that\\u2019s first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue, we\\u2019ve got to know who\\u2019s coming and going into the country \\u2013 we\\u2019ve got to secure the border.\\u201d\\nMr Ryan\\u2019s remarks seemed to indicate yet another U-turn in policy proposals for the President-elect. On Friday, he told the Wall Street Journal that he would more than likely keep some parts of the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as \\u201cObamacare\\u201d, rather than completely repealing it.\\n\\u201cEither Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\\u201d Mr Trump told the newspaper following his 90-minute meeting with President Barack Obama. \\u201cI told him I will look at his suggestions and, out of respect, I will do that.\\u201d While Mr Obama said he felt \\u201cencouraged\\u201d by the Thursday meeting, a signifcant number of Americans believe Mr Trump\\u2019s election will mark a dark, new phase for the United States, as he intends to dismantle much of the sitting President\\u2019s legacy.\\nMillions of protesters took to the streets after election night to protest over Mr Trump\\u2019s defeat of Hillary Clinton. While the New York businessman did win enough electoral votes to make it to the White House, Ms Clinton took the popular vote \\u2013 more than any US president in history, with the exception of Mr Obama.\\nProtests filled roads in major cities, like Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, and echoed with chants of \\u201cnot my president\\u201d and \\u201cdump Trump\\u201d. Dissenters are using the protests to rebuke the racism and bigotry promoted by the Trump campaign, as manifested through policy proposals like building a wall along the border, mass deportations, and the blockade of Muslim immigrants.\\nMr Trump\\u2019s victory has galvanised white supremacists across the country, as a wave of reported hate crimesreaches new highs. Neo-Nazi and Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin exalted Mr Trump as a \\u201cGod Emperor\\u201d following Tuesday night\\u2019s election results.\\n\\u201cOur Glorious Leader has ascended to God Emperor. Make no mistake about it: we did this. If it were not for us, it wouldn\\u2019t have been possible,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201c[T]he White race is back in the game. And if we\\u2019re playing, no one can beat us. The winning is not going to stop.\\u201d The Ku Klux Klan also announced a victory parade for the beginning of December in North Carolina.\\nCivil rights organisations are preparing themselves for the incoming Trump administration. The American Civil Liberties Union published a full-page ad in the New York Times with an open letter threatening to sue Mr Trump. \\u201cif you do not reverse course and endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality,\\u201d the ACLU wrote, \\u201cyou will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at your every step.\\u201d\\nSource : (Independent UK) \\n\", \"source_id\": 19982, \"article_id\": 334624}"
