Bush, and he plans to continue his support for the GOP this year. \\nIt's a trend he hopes other black voters will follow in this election. To those who say Trump isn't with the blacks, how come Clarence Henderson, one of the men involved with the Woolworth sit ins, supports him? pic.twitter.com/SMKuUBuT9N \\u2014 chad (@chadmattk) October 16, 2016 \\nAs to why he specifically supports Trump, Henderson has said he believes that \\u201cAmerica is a business,\\u201d and that Trump has the experience to run it: \\n\\\"He has proved to be a leader in the business field. Has he done everything right? No, certainly not. \\nBut I think that he has more at stake than Hillary does.\\\" \\nIt's a stance Henderson expounded on during a CNN interview in August: \\nWhen asked by CNN\\u2019s Jim Sciutto how he could reconcile his civil rights background with Trump's \\u201c ties to folks who have said and propagated some racist things,\\u201d Henderson responded : \\n\\\"See I come from an era of time known as 'Jim Crow,' and I know what racism is and what racism isn't... \\nI'm not looking to like Donald Trump, I'm looking at what he will do. \\nI look at the history of the Republican party versus the history of the Democratic party, and for the last eight years we have been put in dire straights because the policies that have been put in place such as Obamacare... \\nWe need jobs as opposed to things that are happening right now.\\\" \\nThough Henderson has faced criticism for his support of Trump, he says he doesn't mind, as he'd \\u201crather be in the minority on the side of justice than in the majority on the side of injustice.\\u201d \\nWhether or not it's because of the support of men like Henderson, though, Trump has seen a sharp rise in his support among black voters. \\nA more recent poll , courtesy of Los Angeles Times/University of Southern California, put \\u201cTrump's support among black voters at 20.1 percent \\u2014 up from 3.1 percent on Sept. 10.\\u201d \", \"source_id\": 6420, \"article_id\": 321002}"
