"{\"title\": \"Americans' Support for 'Assault Weapons' Ban at Record Low\", \"content\": \"Getty - Thomas Cooper \\nSupport for a ban on \\u201cassault weapons\\u201d is at the lowest rate in two decades, according to a poll released Wednesday. \\nIn an October survey from Gallup, 36 percent of Americans favor an assault weapons ban, down 21 percent since the pollster asked the same question in 1996.

According to Gallup, 55 percent of Americans think gun transactions should be more strict. However, that figure is also lower than levels from the 1990s. \\nWhile assault rifles with selective fire are limited to military use absent a very rare and special permit, proposed assault weapons bans generally encompass semiautomatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns that some lawmakers deem too dangerous for public use. \\nGun rights and gun violence issues have been at the forefront of the presidential election for much of the year. But with many terrorist attacks and mass shootings resulting politicians' calls for bans, the opposition has only grown stronger. \", \"source_id\": 6420, \"article_id\": 320998}"
