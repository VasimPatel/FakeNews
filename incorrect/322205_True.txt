Wolf a bill that would block public officials from immediately releasing the names of officers involved in such incidents. \\nThe measure, sponsored by Republican state Rep. Martina White of Philadelphia and approved by the GOP-controlled legislature, stoked sharp opinions and drew votes largely along partisan lines. \\nSupporters say the bill, supported by several local police unions, is necessary to protect police officers and their families after such incidents. \\n\\u201cWe are the protectors of our protectors,\\u201d said one proponent, Rep. Dominic Costa, a Pittsburgh De mocrat. \\nOpponents said the bill flies in the face of transparency, which they believe is even more critical in tragic circumstances involving police shootings. \\n\\u201cDo not undermine the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color,\\u201d said Rep. Margo Davidson (D., Delaware) during a floor debate. \\u201cThis legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 7588, \"article_id\": 322205}"
