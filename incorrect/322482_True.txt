"{\"content\": \"Rihanna In Child Porn Photos? \\nBy Comment \\nRihanna is no stranger to controversy, but this time, she is being accused of releasing a so-called child porn photo. The controversial picture, which was posted by the 28-year-old singer on Instagram, shows her and niece Majesty in the bathroom in a very intimate moment \\u2013 and fully naked. \\nAlthough the photo of the \\u201cUmbrella\\u201d singer and Majesty was apparently done in good taste, netizens couldn\\u2019t help criticizing the Barbadian born artist for sharing such an intimate picture. Many of them perhaps believed that such private matters should not make their way to the public sphere. \\nIn fact, social media is buzzing with comments which blast Rihanna for spreading what some describe as child porn photos. One troll commented on Instagram, \\u201cSo inappropriate, what\\u2019s wrong with society,\\u201d while another dissenter wrote, \\u201cThis is bad, OMG \\u2013 I need to report this.\\u201d \\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t this child porn?\\u201d asked one vocal critic. Another said: \\u201cOmg hell to the no, too many weirdos on here \\u2013 take it down @badgalriri,\\u201d according to Yahoo! News . \\nALSO READ: Brad Pitt, Rihanna Dating Rumors: RiRi Obsessed With Actor, Wants Romantic Nights With Him? \\nIn the meantime, there are also other industry insiders who, instead of calling out the \\u201cDiamonds\\u201d singer for her supposed snafu, have praised her for her openness. Perez Hilton has even described the pop icon as the \\u201ccoolest baby sitter ever.\\u201d \\nInstead of hitting the singing superstar, the popular celebrity blogger pointed out that Rihanna was far from releasing child porn photos, but was just showing her unconditional love for her niece with the \\u201cbath snap.\\u201d \\nHilton himself has also been involved in a similar controversy after he posted a photo of himself on social media taking a bath with his son. Many of his followers unfollowed him after he released the said picture, reported Yahoo! News . \\nMany of Hilton\\u2019s fans came to his rescue, as they noted that nudity between parents and children are perfectly normal. It would be nice to hear Rihanna\\u2019s followers showing their support to their idol, and help reverse the rumor that she has proliferating child porn photos. \\nWant to receive more news updates on Rihanna ?
