Watch protester relives Trump fans\\u2019 attack at Nevada rally: \\n\\u201cI just went with sign that said \\u2018Republicans Against Trump,'\\u201d Crites told the Reno Gazette-Journa l . \\u201cIt\\u2019s a sign that you can find online. I held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there. Then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands.\\u201d He said he had no intentions other than to let his opinion be known. He expected to be booed and perhaps led away, but not pummeled nearly to death. \\n\\u201cMultiple people just tackled me down, kicking me choking me and just beating me up,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s when things even got crazier. I was on the ground and people were holding my arms, legs and I kept saying I can barely breathe. I was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out.\\u201d The police, he said, intervened just in time. \\nAccording to the Guardian : The 33-year-old \\u2013 who says he has been a registered Republican for about six years \\u2013 said he was kicked, punched and choked, and feared for his life when the crowd turned on him at the gathering in Reno, Nevada . Crites cited Trump\\u2019s treatment of Mexicans, Muslims and women as the reason he decided to protest again Trump, who he described as \\u201ca textbook version of a dictator and a fascist\\u201d. There were panicked scenes at the Trump rally, apparently prompted by shouts from at least one person in the crowd that the protester had a gun. Hundreds of people fled to the the back of the auditorium in panic as Trump was hurriedly rushed from the stage by his security detail. \\nAs the following clip of the unfolding incident shows, Trump acknowledges someone in the crowd during his remarks, saying, \\u201cOh we have one of those guys from the Hillary Clinton campaign. How much are you being paid, $1,500?\\u201d As the crowd begins to agitate and boo, Trump then says, \\u201cOkay. Take him out.\\u201d Just seconds later, as the scuffle appears to intensify, is when agents quickly approach Trump and take him off stage. Watch Donald Trump Rushed Off Stage by Secret Service: After Crites was removed from the event by security and police, Trump returned to the stage and told his supporters. \\u201cNo one said it would be easy.\\u201d \\nThough Republicans and Trump supporters on social media overnight were calling him a \\u201cthug\\u201d\\u201cinfiltrator\\u201d and \\u201cClinton shill,\\u201d Crites posted a Facebook message (subsequently deleted) which said he has nothing official to do with the Clinton campaign, though he is supporting the Democratic candidate this year over Trump and has donated to her campaign. \\n\\u201cTake what happened to me tonight,\\u201d Crites wrote to his fellow Republicans in the post, \\u201cas a classic example of dictator incitement of violence \\u2014 against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign.\\u201d This work by Common Dreams is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 International License.
