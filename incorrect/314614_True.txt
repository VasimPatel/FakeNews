Calling Hillary Clinton a \\u201cbigot\\u201d has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and it\\u2019s all okey-dokey? \\nThen again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder there\\u2019s a collective ho-hum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling \\u201cKKK values.\\u201d \\nThis is what Democrats do. It didn\\u2019t start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group. \\nEach presidential election, the drill goes like this: \\nAfter Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove he\\u2019s not a hater \\u2013 of African-Americans, of women, of gays, etc. \\nThis year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney , John McCain and George W. Bush . Of course, this isn\\u2019t what they were saying back when these men were running for president. \\n\\u2022 In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that then-Gov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrd\\u2019s daughter says, \\u201cSo when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.\\u201d \\n\\u2022 When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying, \\u201cYou know, he doesn\\u2019t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.\\u201d The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the \\u201cbottom of the deck.\\u201d Funny thing: All those reporters always hearing \\u201cdog whistles\\u201d from Republicans somehow didn\\u2019t hear this one. \\n\\u2022 In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them face-to-face about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote. Vice President Joe Biden put it more explicitly, telling a largely African-American audience that if Mr. Romney were to win, he\\u2019d \\u201cput ya\\u2019ll back in chains.\\u201d \\nThe only difference today is that Republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets\\u2026\", \"source_id\": 49, \"article_id\": 314614}"
