"{\"content\": \"'Budget Amendment' for More Troops in Iraq, Afghanistan   \\nThe Pentagon has announced it will file a \\u201cbudget amendment\\u201d seeking another $6 billion in funding for the current fiscal year to pay for additional overseas troop deployments above and beyond what was already in the budget for this year. \\nThe $6 billion request comes as an \\u201curgent\\u201d request from the Pentagon, and would pay for additional ground troops in Iraq, the additional troops left in Afghanistan by stalling the drawdown, and to pay for escalated airstrikes around the world. \\nPentagon Comptroller Mike McCord says the hope is to get the White House to approve submitting the request to Congress before next week\\u2019s election, with an eye at getting it added to the latest emergency spending bill, expected before early December. \\nThese \\u201cemergency\\u201d funding bills are the main way to get around spending caps, with Congress deliberately funding the Pentagon only for a portion of the year with money that, by the cap\\u2019s reckoning, was the whole year\\u2019s budget, then slipping \\u201cemergency\\u201d bills in afterwards to pay for the rest of the year, while pretending the caps still exist.  \", \"article_id\": 315505, \"source_id\": 887, \"title\": \"Pentagon Seeks Another $6 Billion for Overseas Troop Deployments\"}"
