The only issue: She wasn\\u2019t. \\n\\u201cI know what happened, not far from here at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando,\\u201d Clinton said at a rally in Florida. \\u201cI was in New York City on 9/11, as one of the two senators. I will defeat ISIS , I will protect America.\\u201d Hillary says she was in New York City on 9/11 (She wasn\\u2019t) pic.twitter.com/3ppmncpeTI \\n\\u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 2, 2016 \\nBut Clinton was in Washington D.C. on 9/11, which is unsurprising, as Congress was in session and she was the sitting senator for New York. In the words of Politico, which wrote about her actions that day: \\nShe had CNN on as she talked on the phone with her legislative director when the first plane hit. Then the second. By the time she got to the Capitol, the Pentagon had been hit by a third plane. Capitol police were evacuating Senate office buildings. She dialed her daughter, who was in New York. She dialed her husband, who was in Australia. She and other senators received a briefing at the Capitol police station early in the evening. And after \\u201ca day indelibly etched in my mind,\\u201d and as nightfall approached, Clinton joined congressional colleagues on the steps of the Capitol, standing next to some of her fiercest political opponents, singing \\u201cGod Bless America\\u201d with tears in her eyes. \\nClinton did go back to New York, but only the following day. Since all regular air traffic was grounded, she flew on a special FEMA flight to the city with Rep. Charlie Rangel and fellow Sen. Chuck Schumer. \\nArticle reposted with permission from The Daily Caller  \", \"source_id\": 5208, \"article_id\": 319851}"
