"{\"title\": \"NSA contractor accused of spying stole real names of US undercover officers\", \"content\": \"NSA contractor accused of spying stole real names of US undercover officers   Intel News \\nClassified information stolen by a United States federal contractor, who was charged with espionage last month, includes the true identities of American intelligence officers posted in undercover assignments abroad, according to court documents. In August of this year, Harold Thomas Martin III, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges of stealing government property and illegally removing classified material. Martin, 51, served as a US Navy officer for over a decade, where he acquired a top secret clearance and specialized in cyber security. At the time of his arrest earlier this year, he was working for Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the largest federal contractors in the US. Some media reports said Martin was a member of the National Security Agency\\u2019s Office of Tailored Access Operations, described by observers as an elite \\u201chacker army\\u201d tasked with conducting offensive cyber espionage against foreign targets. \\nLast week, after prosecutors alleged that the information Martin removed from the NSA was the equivalent of 500 million pages, a judge in the US state of Maryland ruled that the accused might flee if he is released on bail. Soon afterwards, Martin\\u2019s legal team filed a motion asking the judge to reconsider his decision to deny him bail. That prompted a new filing by the prosecution, which was delivered to the court on Thursday. The document alleges that the information found in Martin\\u2019s home and car includes \\u201cnumerous names\\u201d of American intelligence officers who currently \\u201coperate under cover outside the US\\u201d. The court filing adds that Martin\\u2019s removal of the documents from secure government facilities constitutes \\u201ca security breach that risks exposure of American intelligence operations\\u201d and \\u201ccould endanger the lives\\u201d of undercover intelligence officers and their agents abroad. \\nIt is alleged that Martin told the FBI he never shared classified information with anyone, and that he removed it from his office at the NSA in order to deepen his expertise on his subject. His legal team argues that Martin suffers from a mental condition that compels him to be a hoarder. But prosecutors for the government argue in court documents that Martin appears to have communicated via the Internet with Russian speakers, and that he was learning Russian at the time of his arrest. The case is expected to be tried later this year.\", \"source_id\": 1395, \"article_id\": 315983}"
