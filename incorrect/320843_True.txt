LePage Threatens To \\u2018Investigate\\u2019 College Students For Fraud If They Vote (VIDEO)\", \"content\": \"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \\nOn Monday, Paul LePage, Maine\\u2019s infamous racist Governor, issued a statement which basically threatened any out-of-state student attending college in his state with an investigation should they decide to vote. \\nLePage\\u2019s statement came on the eve of Election Day, and many believe it was designed to scare Democratic leaning college students away from the polls. \\nThe governor complained about Democrats encouraging out-of-state students to commit voter fraud by voting in both their home state and the state where they are attending college. He also said that \\u201cthere is no way to determine\\u201d if a person has cast his or her ballot in two states. \\nThe Washington Post : \\n\\u201cDemocrats for decades have encouraged college students from out of state to vote in Maine, even though there is no way to determine whether these college students also voted in their home states,\\u201d LePage said in a statement. \\n\\u201cCasting ballots in two different states is voter fraud, which is why Maine law requires anyone voting here to establish residency here. We welcome college students establishing residency in our great state, as long as they follow all laws that regulate voting, motor vehicles and taxes. We cannot tolerate voter fraud in our state.\\u201d \\nLePage continued, \\u201cAfter the election, we will do everything we can that is allowed under state and federal law to verify college students who voted here are following Maine law, which is clearly displayed on the Secretary of State\\u2019s website.\\u201d \\nHowever, Maine\\u2019s Secretary of State, Matthew Dunlap, says that they do have a system in place to detected that kind of voter fraud, and they\\u2019ve yet to find evidence of this being a real issue. Dunlap told WMTW ABC 8: \\n\\u201cPeople are not voting in two different jurisdictions. In fact, the Secretary of State\\u2019s office back in 2011 did just such an investigation of over 200 students who were from out of state, and who had registered and voted in Maine to see if they had voted in their home state, and nobody did.\\u201d \\nAlong with the Governor\\u2019s statement, college students at Bates College received a mysterious orange flyer informing them that if they are out of state, students that they must change their driver\\u2019s license and re-register their vehicle (which the flyer claimed cost \\u201cusually hundreds of dollars in total\\u201d). \\nThe flyer included an official government website address, as well as references to several state statutes regarding the registration of personal motorized vehicles in Maine. College students in Maine: This flyer is FALSE. You may use your dorm as your legal address to vote. pic.twitter.com/jOE6MvH02s \\n\\u2014 Maine College Dems (@MECollegeDem) November 7, 2016 \\nTo the average college student, this flyer would probably seem legit. However, as the above tweet states, college students are allowed to use their dorm address as their permanent residence while attending school in the state. \\nMaine\\u2019s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has requested that the Justice Department step in to investigate. \\n\\u201cThe governor\\u2019s statement seems designed to make college students afraid to vote,\\u201d Zachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. \\u201cVoter intimidation and harassment is illegal, and we call on the Department of Justice to investigate the intent of the governor\\u2019s comments. \\n\\u201cCollege students who live in Maine have the right to vote in Maine, and they are not subject to different laws than anyone else. Many of these young people are voting for the first time in a presidential election. The governor should be encouraging that civic participation, not doing everything in his power to undermine it.\\u201d \\nMaine\\u2019s Democratic party is calling this a classic case of GOP voter suppression efforts aimed at minority groups whom they feel will vote Democratic. \\n\\u201cThe false information contained in these fliers is a deliberate attempt to suppress the millennial vote,\\u201d Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett said in a statement. \\u201cThere is nothing in Maine law that states that college students must change their driver\\u2019s licenses in order to vote. \\n\\u201cIn fact, the Secretary of State\\u2019s office has made explicitly clear that a dorm can be a student\\u2019s legal voting residence, and that paying out-of-state tuition does not preclude a student from voting. Maine also has same-day voter registration, so students who are not registered to vote in Maine can still register on Election Day. We urge all Bates students to spread the word to their fellow classmates about their voting rights here in Maine.\\u201d \\nDespite their best efforts, numerous states are reporting record turnout numbers, which traditionally doesn\\u2019t bode well for Republicans who prefer low voter turnout for any group that\\u2019s isn\\u2019t non-educated, white, and male. \\nFeatured image via YouTube\", \"source_id\": 6220, \"article_id\": 320843}"
