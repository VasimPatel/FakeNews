"{\"title\": \"Bill Clinton Inc: Billions for the Foundation, $116 Million for the Clintons\", \"source_id\": 5408, \"content\": \"Bill Clinton Inc: Billions for the Foundation, $116 Million for the Clintons October 27, 2016 \\nCall it the unintended revenge of Doug Band. \\nBand used to be Bill's Huma, the guy that the big guy couldn't go to the bathroom without, let alone perform the simplest tasks. The Clinton Foundation was a Band project. The waters grew murkier, but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating Doug Band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called, running Bill Clinton Inc. \\nAnd Band was also organizing personal income directly for Clinton. Under the heading, \\u201cFor-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e. Bill Clinton, Inc.),\\u201d Band wrote, \\u201cWe have dedicated our selves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities\\u2014including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements\\u2026 In support of the President\\u2019s for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family\\u2014for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities (e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than $50 million in for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the $66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements).\\u201d \\nBand mentions four such \\u201carrangements\\u201d without naming them. Bill Clinton was paid nearly $18 million to be \\u201chonorary chancellor\\u201d of a for-profit college, Laureate International Universities, according to reports and the family\\u2019s tax returns. A Dubai-based firm, GEMS Education, paid Bill Clinton more than $560,000 in 2015, according to the tax returns. Band also lists a variety of speaking fees, previously disclosed by the Clintons, including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from UBS, Ericsson, BHP and Barclays. In 2011 alone, according to the Clinton\\u2019s tax returns, Bill Clinton earned $13,454,000 in speaking fees. \\nOf course there was lots of \\\"synergy\\\" between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff, between Doug's Teneo interests and the entire Clintonworld octopus. \\n\\\"We have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities,\\\" Band wrote. He also said he had \\\"sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the foundation.\\\" \\nBand's memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneo's 20 clients at the time had given to the Clinton Foundation, how much they had paid Bill Clinton and, in some cases, how he or Kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments. \\nBand wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation and $3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton. He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out $66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place. \\nBand also described how Kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with UBS Global Wealth Management, introducing Bill Clinton to a top executive at a 2009 charity dinner. In the ensuing years, UBS upped its giving to the foundation, signed on as a Teneo client and agreed to pay Bill Clinton for speeches, Band wrote. \\nBand was actually making the case that the entire network of the Clinton Foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the Clintons. Not to mention the interests of people around them. \\nBanks and major corporations were doing business with Bill's toady, paying Bill money and donating to the Clinton Foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part, \\nBand described in the memo how he combined his work for CGI and Teneo. He wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the 2011 CGI gathering to meet with Teneo clients. He also acknowledged giving free CGI memberships to \\\"target Teneo clients\\\" being cultivated as potential foundation donors. Memberships generally cost $20,000 a year. \\nTeneo, meanwhile, named Bill Clinton its \\\"honorary chairman.\\\" Clinton had been initially tapped for a three-year arrangement in which he would provide advice to Teneo \\\"regarding geopolitical, economic and social trends,\\\" according to a separate June 2011 memo that Band wrote to the State Department seeking ethics approval for the former president's employment. \\nBill Clinton was initially paid $2 million by Teneo, according to \\\"Man of the World,\\\" a book written with the former president's participation by author Joe Conason. \\nAnd here's where it gets appropriately entertaining. \\nBut Band outlined that Kelly, his Teneo co-founder, had served simultaneously between 2009 and 2011 as an unpaid economic envoy to Northern Ireland appointed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included Coke, UBS and Dow. Band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with Kelly's State Department ethics agreement. \\nKelly's multiple roles came together during one State Department event in 2010, when then-Secretary Clinton recognized Dow, among other companies, for creating jobs in Northern Ireland and thanked Kelly for his work on the issue. \\nDow became one of Teneo's first major clients. According to Band's memo, Dow chief executive Andrew Liveris had been introduced to Bill Clinton over a round of golf with Kelly in August 2009. \\nThat's not consistent with mafia ethics agreements, but it's all good in Clintonworld.\", \"article_id\": 319962}"
