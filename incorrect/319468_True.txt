Turns out the event didn\\u2019t go as planned. You will follow the program\\u2026 \\nFrom MyNorthwest.com : As the Federal Way controversy over a high school Black Lives Matter event continues, one person is not around school to see how tensions are being addressed. \\n\\u201cI feel very unsafe going back to that school,\\u201d said Ellie Mae Haine, further saying she feels like she is in danger at Todd Beamer High School. \\u201cAs it stands right now I don\\u2019t feel safe going to that school,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no possible way I could go back right now.\\u201d \\nEllie is a 14-years-old freshman at Todd Beamer High School. \\nOne week ago, a student was arrested after allegedly fighting, and then assaulting an on-campus police officer. A Black Lives Matter event was organized the following week \\u2014 kids were encouraged to wear black . It was organized by students. But Haine did not want to participate. \\n\\u201cWe were all pressured into wearing black because it seemed that most of the teachers agreed with this movement ,\\u201d Ellie said. \\u201cAnd we couldn\\u2019t\\u2019 decide whether we should participate or not. And I just went for it and didn\\u2019t participate. \\n\\u201cWhen it comes down to it, I don\\u2019t think it should have anything to do with race. I just thought it was someone who didn\\u2019t have enough discipline or respect for authority.\\u201d \\nTensions between students who supported the Black Lives Matter event and those who did not participate erupted in the days since the initial arrest. It led to a school board meeting, where Ellie spoke, saying: \\u201cI still don\\u2019t understand why we were told to wear black to show support for this girl who has assaulted police officers more than just last week.\\u201d Todd Beamer High School Principal Joni Hall \\nThe next day, Ellie returned to school. \\n\\u201cThe day after the school board meeting, I came to school,\\u201d she said. \\u201cEverything went well until lunch. We were standing in the hallway outside of the cafeteria \\u2013 I was with about 15 friends.\\u201d \\n\\u201cThe girl who had been arrested and who assaulted the cop, she came up to me and started yelling profanities in my face and seemed really angry,\\u201d Ellie said. \\u201c Before I had any time to explain myself, a mob of 50-60 angry students came yelling my name. Most of them I didn\\u2019t know. My friends pushed me behind them because they saw that this wasn\\u2019t good.\\u201d \\nTeachers came and were pushing back the crowd of students. Ellie found a police officer in the lunch room nearby. He escorted her outside the building. Her mom came to pick her up and the officer advised that the freshman stay away from school for a couple of days until things calmed down . \\nEllie and her mom met with school officials and some of the high school\\u2019s Black Lives Matter students. She said that one of the Black Lives Matter students said he didn\\u2019t like how things had turned out. He offered to escort her from class to class and defend her if need be. \\nDCG\", \"source_id\": 4893, \"article_id\": 319468}"
