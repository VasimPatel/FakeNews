"{\"title\": \"American Indian group mocks racist sports mascots in the most brilliant way\", \"source_id\": 20871, \"article_id\": 335419, \"content\": \"Zach Cartwright | November 6, 2016 \\nA prominent Native American association is making a powerful statement about offensive sports team logos using indigenous people as mascots. \\nThe National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), which is behind the effort to change the names and logos of the Washington Redskins football team and the Cleveland Indians baseball team, is circulating a purposefully offensive image using other ethnicities as mascots to promote dialogue about the inappropriateness of having an ethnic stereotype as the face of a team. \\nIn a poster made by the NCAI, several imaginary sports teams \\u2014 the New York Jews, the San Francisco Chinamen, and the actual Cleveland Indians are all seen side-by-side. The \\u201cNew York Jews\\u201d mascot is a hook-nosed, bespectacled grinning face, the \\u201cSan Francisco Chinamen\\u201d logo is a buck-toothed Chinese stereotype in a traditional sedge hat, and the Cleveland Indians logo is depicted next to the other two offensive images. \\nThe evolution of offensive portrayals of Native Americans is nothing new in sports. As Indian County Today Media Network\\u2019s Vincent Schilling reported, Chief Wahoo \\u2014 the mascot of the Cleveland Indians \\u2014 goes back to 1928, when the team used various depictions of a Native American man in traditional headdress for its official team logo. Between 1947 and 1951, Chief Wahoo had yellow skin. After a body was added to Chief Wahoo, the mascot\\u2019s skin color was changed to a deep crimson. The Chief Wahoo known by baseball fans today has been the Cleveland Indians\\u2019 logo since 1972. \\nAs the NFL season continues, pressure is increasing on the Washington Redskins to change their name and mascot, after years of pressure from indigenous groups. An op-ed posted on ESPN in 2015 argued a change in the team\\u2019s name is \\u201c inevitable ,\\u201d saying team owner Daniel Snyder is clinging to the past. Author Mike Wise cited the example of NFL referee Mike Carey, who asked the league to not assign him to Washington Redskins games for the final years of his career, saying he didn\\u2019t want to take part in disrespecting Native Americans. \\nSports fans are pushing the change the names of the teams through online petitions. A MoveOn.org petition asking the Redskins to change their name has garnered nearly 8,000 signatures as of this writing, and a Change.org petition to Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan asking the team to retire the Chief Wahoo logo has nearly 14,000 signatures. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.
