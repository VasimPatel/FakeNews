The planes, simulating an adversary force, were spotted over Eastern European and Central Asian airspaces, the Russian military said. \\nAll units are being coordinated from a Russian Air Force command center located outside Moscow. \\nThe joint CIS air defense system, established in 1995, currently focuses on protecting the ex-Soviet countries\\u2019 airspace as well as providing air or missile strike early warnings and coordinated responses. \\nRussia contributes the bulk of the system\\u2019s early warning and air defense capacities, with short- and long-range radar stations monitoring the area. \\nNotably, the system does not have a single commander.

Last December, an air defense agreement between Russia and Armenia was signed by the two countries\\u2019 defense ministers, Sergey Shoigu and Seyran Oganyan, respectively. \\nIn 2013 Moscow signed a separate treaty on a joint regional air defense system with Kazakhstan. Russian and Belarusian anti-aircraft missile forces have already been unified into an integrated system designed to contain any security threats in the European theater.\", \"article_id\": 336585, \"title\": \"Russia & CIS Countries Launch Massive Air Drills\", \"source_id\": 22036}"
