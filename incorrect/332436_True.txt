"{\"content\": \"\\nFresh reports are confirming what we already knew \\u2013 that Hillary Clinton was nowhere to be seen on election night because she was preoccupied with a terrible rage, losing it once again in front of her closest circle of staff and surrogates.\\nIf these accounts have any validity, she was absolutely livid. Is there a more dangerous enemy to make, or a more unstable person to attempt to gain power over the nation?\\nAccording to The Gateway Pundit :\\nRadio host Todd Kincannon from The Kincannon Show tweeted today that a CNN reporter told him Hillary Clinton became physically violent towards Robby Mook and John Podesta around midnight last Tuesday as the presidency was slipping away.\\nHillary was reportedly drunk and had a violent temper on full display. For one reason or another, she did not appear on stage election night to concede, delay, or anything else.\\nAnd it appears there was good reason for it, as she was busy lashing out, blaming those around and closest too her and playing the victim as her loss became more and more apparent.\\nCNN reporter tells me Hillary became physically violent towards Robby Mook and John Podesta around midnight; had to be briefly restrained.\\n\\u2014 The Kincannon Show (@kincannon_show) November 14, 2016 \\n\\nShe was. I posted about that too. She was in a \\u201cpsychotic drunken rage\\u201d according to my reporter friend. Doctor added sedatives to the mix. https://t.co/jZv376ydDM \\n\\u2014 The Kincannon Show (@kincannon_show) November 15, 2016 \\n\\nThe report is unconfirmed, but is hardly surprising. It seems to fit the narrative we all expected.\\nAlready accounts of that fateful election night have emerged of Hillary crying and sobbing all night, and rambling incoherently to her staff and support network.\\nIn between her sobbing fits, Hillary reportedly remembered to blame FBI Director Comey as well as the media \\u2013 and likely many others \\u2013 for her loss :\\nHere\\u2019s what I know, not my opinion. About 6:30 this morning she called an old friend. She was crying inconsolably. She couldn\\u2019t stop crying. And her friend, her female friend from way, way back said it was even hard to understand what she was saying she was crying so hard. This is Hillary we\\u2019re talking about. \\nEventually her friend said she could make out that she was blaming James Comey, the Director of the FBI, for her loss , and, I don\\u2019t understand exactly, the president of the United States for not doing enough. (via Gateway Pundit )\\n\\nOnly a few weeks before the election, a report emerged about Hillary\\u2019s alleged behavior backstage after the Commander-in-Chief Forum (the first pseudo-debate against Trump). According to the report, she went fully ballistic after host Matt Lauer was \\u2018allowed\\u2019 to ask an unscripted question pushing her on the email scandal:\\nBehind the scenes, NBC technicians and cameramen at the Wednesday night, Commander-in-Chief Forum (Sept 7) report that Hillary Clinton was so angry and incensed that she had been \\u2018blind-sided\\u2019 by one question she was not prepared for and had not approved in advance. \\n\\u201cWhen her time in front of the cameras ended, Clinton shook the hand Lauer extended to her and smiled once more for the wide camera shot and then Hillary proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and threw it at the face of her assistant and the screaming started. She was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her \\n[\\u2026]\\n[Hillary was] screaming at her staff, \\u201cyou f \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 ing idiots, you were supposed to have this thing set up for me and you\\u2019ve screwed it up! If that f \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 ing bastard wins we all hang from nooses! Lauer\\u2019s finished\\u2026and if I lose it\\u2019s all on you ass \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 s for screwing this up.\\u201d \\n[\\u2026]\\nInterim DNC chairman Donna Brazile, the first black woman to hold the position, was singled out by Hillary during the rant. She screamed at Donna, \\u201cI\\u2019m so sick of your face. You stare at the wall like a brain dead buffalo, while letting that f \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 ing Lauer get away with this. What are you good for, really? Get the f \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 to work janitoring this mess \\u2013 do I make myself clear?\\u201d\\n\\n\\nMuch more could be said about the reputation that precedes Hillary, her angry and demeaning temper, throwing objects, etc. but there is no need to go on.\\nThe people of the United States dodged a devil\\u2026 but that doesn\\u2019t mean that more evil isn\\u2019t fast approaching with the cesspool that is Washington.\\nNo election is going to break the cycle of corruption and criminality that has long defined the actions of the leaders of the federal government.\\nRead more: \\nWe Finally Know Why Hillary Disappeared On Election Night: \\u201cShe Was Crying Inconsolably\\u2026 It Was Hard To Understand What She Was Saying She Was Crying So Hard\\u201d \\nIs Something Wrong With Hillary?
