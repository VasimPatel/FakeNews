"{\"content\": \"November 10, 2016 \\nSnapchat, the final evolutionary stage before society gives up on sentences altogether and we start communicating in a series of emotive grunts, has seen a steep fall in share prices after proper adults figure out how to use the application successfully. Observers have described the phenomenon, \\u2018Abnormal\\u2019, \\u2018Chilling\\u2019 and \\u2018Like watching a dog doing the hoovering \\u2013 not something that should be in a sane world.\\u2019 \\nThe photographic bants-platform first believed adult use of Snapchat was an anomaly caused by over-protective parents rooting through their teenager\\u2019s belongings in search for evidence of pre-marital sex and \\u2018The Reefer\\u2019. However, pattern analysis of messages suggests the missives were sent intentionally as part of a deliberate campaign to be seen as, \\u2018Not hurtling inexorably towards the grave\\u2019. Company bosses are reported to be, \\u2018Gutted\\u2019. \\n\\u2018It\\u2019s a death knell\\u2019 said CEO Michaela Hodgkinson. \\u2018This will just about wipe out our user base. And we tried so hard. We made it so counter-intuitive to people who didn\\u2019t grow up with access to enough pixilated tits and ass to wrap multiple times round the Milky Way like an erotic flesh sausage. God, I wish it were the good old days, when adults treated innovation with the sort of suspicion usually reserved for men called \\u2018Mohammed\\u2019 walking into a small town Texan airport.\\u2019 \\n\\u2018It is a well-known fact that adolescents instinctively recoil from in shame, disgust and loathing to anything enjoyed by the over 30\\u2019s,\\u2019 explained youth-guru Samuel Cook. \\u2018Look at Michael Bolton. Once upon a time, the mere Herbal-Essence-esque swoosh of his flowing easy-listening locks could obliterate juvenile knickers like the oncoming of a Biblical flood; now, I\\u2019ve seen a teenager to projectile vomit the words, \\u2018Cock-nugget\\u2019 just by hearing the opening bars to \\u2018When A Man Loves A Woman\\u2019. \\nExperts suggest that teenagers\\u2019 influence over what is cool acts as compensation for a future without the possibility of jobs, savings, or affordable housing, at least until their parents pop their clogs and they can wrench a decent standard of living out of their elder\\u2019s hoary baby-boomer claws. Teenagers are expected to flee the social media site like rats aboard a sinking over-60s cruise ship and seek pastures even more disorientating and obtuse. Prospective new digital street-corners-outside-the-offie include, \\u2018Bluster\\u2019, \\u2018Waffle\\u2019 and a messaging service where users communicate entirely using quotes from the 1988 film Beetlejuice.
