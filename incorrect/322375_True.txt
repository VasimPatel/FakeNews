Watch \\u2018 Green Party Nominee Margaret Flowers Interrupt Senate Debate \\u2018: \\nAfter briefly holding forth on the stage, police escorted her from the premises. As she was being led away, Flowers loudly declared that the way alternative candidates like her are treated is \\u201cwhy our Democracy is a sham.\\u201d \\nAfter Flowers was led from the room, an audience member asserted his own support for open debates. He said: \\u201cWe need to have open debates at the national level, at the state level, at all levels. If we\\u2019re supposed to be a democracy, why in God\\u2019s name are we excluding people from democracy? America is supposed to be the model for democracy, and the corporate media telling us that we can\\u2019t have more people at these debates \\u2014 when is it going to end?\\u201d \\nOther members of the audience also voiced support for Flowers\\u2019 inclusion in the debate, including Kevin Zeese, who runs Popular Resistance alongside Flowers and who filmed the incident, shouting: \\u201cLet her on the stage!\\u201d Police escorted both men out of the building. \\nAfter the debate, the Flowers campaign issued a brief statement voicing her support for health care reform, for an end to foreign wars, and for the United States to invest heavily into renewable energy and fighting climate change. In part, the statement reads: \\u201cMy exclusion means the voters will not know what I stand for and how I compare to the other candidates. While I have obvious differences with Republican views, I also have significant differences with Van Hollen. I am one of only twelve congressional candidates in the nation certified as a clean money candidate while Van Hollen has raised millions of dollars from big business lobbyists on K Street including from the fracking industry, weapons makers and big banks.\\u201d \\nAccording to a press release issued on Thursday by the campaign, the Sinclair Broadcast Group has offered to host a three-way debate on one of its stations. Of the three candidates, Van Hollen is the only one who refuses to participate. In the statement, Flowers said: \\u201cChris Van Hollen knows that if I am included in the debate his phony politics will be exposed. I will tell voters that Van Hollen has raised millions of campaign donations from wealthy lobbyists and industries such as natural gas, telecoms and weapons makers as well as how the policies he urges favor Wall Street investors and war. He is avoiding vigorous open debates because he has the funds to buy advertising and not risk being exposed.\\u201d \\nFlowers, who is a pediatrician, became involved in politics and activism after she realized many of her patients and their families could not afford medical care. No stranger to direct action, Flowers was arrested in 2012 for protesting the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and again in 2014 for protesting a natural gas terminal in Cove Point, Maryland . In January 2015 , police escorted her out of the Senate as she interrupted TPP negotiations. \\nShe also serves as co-director of Popular Resistance , which organizes and reports on protests throughout the United States, and occasionally contributes reporting and analysis to MintPress News. \\nIn May, she told MintPress that she saw her candidacy as an opportunity to work with a political party \\u201cthat can work hand in hand with social movements to get the change we need.\\u201d \\n\\u201cWe have to build up a party that is the alternative we want to see, that really is dedicated to social justice and grassroots democracy,\\u201d Flowers said.\", \"source_id\": 7811}"
