"{\"title\": \"Bill Clinton Says He Regrets Showdown With Black Lives Matter Protesters\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Former PresidentBill Clintonsaid Friday that he regretted drowning out the chants of black protesters at a rally in Philadelphia the day before, when he issued an aggressive defense of his administration\\u2019s impact on black families. His reaction thrust a debate about the 1990s into the center of his wife\\u2019s presidential campaign, one that has focused heavily on issues of race and criminal justice.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI know those young people yesterday were just trying to get good television,\\u201d Mr. Clinton said Friday of the Black Lives Matter protesters who had accused him andHillary Clintonof supporting policies that devastated black communities. \\u201cBut that doesn\\u2019t mean that I was most effective in answering it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"His statement did not quiet a raging storm of criticism. Still, it was a remarkable reversal for Mr. Clinton, who occupies a singular role in his wife\\u2019s campaign as a spouse and a popular former president who can sometimes make himself into a lightning rod. He has had to campaign for his wife in an era when signature policies of his administration have been repudiated both by Mrs. Clinton and her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\\\",\\\"None of those issues has been more central to the 2016 campaign than the 1994 crime bill, which created tougher penalties for nonviolent drug offenders, erected dozens of new prisons, banned certain types of assault weapons and sent 100,000 more police officers to American cities.\\\",\\\"Today, Black Lives Matter protesters have pointed to the effects of that legislation as contributing to the high rates of incarceration of black men and the current tensions between police officers and black communities.\\\",\\\"Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders supported the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and have had to answer to Black Lives Matter protesters at their events. Both candidates will face tough questions on racial issues next week at the Rev. Al Sharpton\\u2019s National Action Network annual convention, less than a week before the April 19 New York primary.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI was painting crack houses saying, \\u2018Why isn\\u2019t anyone doing anything about it,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Sharpton recalled of the 1990s. \\u201cBut when that bill came out, we panicked because we felt it would go too far.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Indeed, most Democrats now believe that the bill, which many black leaders supported at the time, did go too far.\\\",\\\"At a convention of the N.A.A.C.P. last July, Mr. Clinton even conceded that the law he championed sent low-level criminals to prison \\u201cfor way too long\\u201d and \\u201cmade the problem worse.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But on Thursday, when confronted with protesters over the issue, the former president refused to silently listen as a signature policy of his presidency was trampled upon.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know how you would characterize gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children,\\u201d an animated Mr. Clinton said, waving a finger. \\u201cMaybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn\\u2019t,\\u201d he said of Mrs. Clinton.\\\",\\\"Thevideoand accountsof his remarks ignited a fierce backlash and came as Mrs. Clinton seeks to solidify the support of black voters, who have voted for her overwhelmingly in primary contests across the South and Midwest.\\\",\\\"In her current campaign, Mrs. Clinton has been a fierce advocate of overhauling the criminal justice system, often campaigning alongside the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and others who have lost children to gun violence or clashes with the police.\\\",\\\"Last April, as protests were consuming Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., after the deaths of black men at the hands of police officers, Mrs. Clinton devoted her first major policy speech to overturning key parts of the bill. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to end the era of mass incarceration,\\u201d she said.\\\",\\\"On Sunday, she addressed three black churches in Brooklyn alongside Nicole Bell, the fianc\\u00e9e of Sean Bell, who was killed in a police shooting the morning of their wedding in 2006.\\\",\\\"In both of Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaigns, Mr. Clinton has proved both her best asset and an occasional liability. He remains widely popular and Mrs. Clinton often talks about his economic achievements. \\u201cWhen he was president, 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody, not just folks at the top,\\u201d she said on Sunday.\\\",\\\"But other parts of Mr. Clinton\\u2019s record, including his support for global trade deals, deficit reduction and deregulation of Wall Street, have haunted Mrs. Clinton, as she confronts a challenge from the left.\\\",\\\"And Mr. Clinton has, at times, been an unpredictable and disruptive presence on the campaign trail. He infuriated blacks in 2008 when, after Senator Barack Obama appeared poised for a landslide victory in South Carolina, Mr. Clinton reminded the news media that Jesse Jackson had won the state\\u2019s Democratic primary twice. He also called Mr. Obama\\u2019s position against the Iraq war \\u201cthe biggest fairy tale I\\u2019ve ever seen.\\u201d\\\",\\\"This time, Mr. Clinton has a close relationship with Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s senior campaign aides and has mostly remained dutifully on message, but the incident on Thursday served as a reminder that he remains a volatile force.\\\",\\\"His clash with black protesters on Thursday also underscored the drastically different political landscape Mrs. Clinton faces from the centrist wave that swept her husband to power.\\\",\\\"When Mr. Clinton ran for president in 1992, crack cocaine was ravaging American cities and theWillie Horton adthat the elder George Bush had used in 1988 to portray Michael Dukakis as soft on crime had wounded theDemocratic Party.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter,\\u201d Mr. Clinton said Thursday to protesters who held up signs that read \\u201cClinton Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities\\u201d and \\u201cBlack Youth Are Not Super Predators,\\u201d a reference to a term used by Mrs. Clinton in 1996 to describe gang members and which she has said she regretted using.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTell the truth,\\u201d Mr. Clinton told them.\\\",\\\"His reaction prompted wide criticism online. \\u201cBill Clinton Reached Peak White Mansplain in a Face-Off Against Black Lives Matter Protesters,\\u201d read a headline in Jezebel. Salon called his response \\u201ccringe worthy.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe just did to an entire generation what he did to Sister Souljah a generation ago,\\u201d Ben Jealous, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P. who is supporting Mr. Sanders, said in an interview, referring to Mr. Clinton\\u2019s forceful rebuttal of the activist and rapper in 1992 for remarks he deemed hateful.\\\",\\\"By Friday, Mr. Clinton said, \\u201cI almost want to apologize.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But Clinton allies said he should be putting into context his record and the landscape he confronted at the time.\\\",\\\"In 1993, violent crime had more than tripled in the previous three decades and law enforcement had not caught up. By the time Mr. Clinton left office, crime had dropped to a 25-year low and the homicide rate had declined by more than 40 percent, according to F.B.I. data. Median family income for African-Americans increased by 33 percent in the Clinton years, according to census data, a statistic he often cites when facing criticism of the 1996 overhaul of the welfare system.\\\",\\\"Representative James E. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, voted for the 1994 crime bill. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no question one of the biggest issues confronting the country at that time was the whole phenomenon of crack cocaine, which had precipitated tremendous anxiety through the African-American community,\\u201d Mr. Clyburn, who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said in an interview.\\\",\\\"But others say that the crime bill and the welfare overhaul, which cut federal spending on assistance for the poor by nearly $55 billion over six years, were done for political expediency at a time when the Democratic Party had lost five out of the last seven presidential campaigns and had to shift to the center to survive.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhat Clinton did well was to stop the erosion of a certain class of Democratic voters who were fleeing to the Republicans,\\u201d said Nicholas Turner, president of the Vera Institute of Justice. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t think about crime policy in this country at that time without thinking about the politics of it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As for Mr. Clinton\\u2019s defense of the crime bill, Mr. Turner said, \\u201cI think the correct answer was simply, \\u2018I was wrong.\\u2019\\u201d\\\"}\"}"
