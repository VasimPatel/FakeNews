"{\"title\": \"Marco Rubio Inches Closer To Unemployment As Poll Shows Florida Senate Race Tie\", \"content\": \"A PPP poll of Florida found: \\nCandidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in Florida. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by four points (48/44), and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy is tied with Republican incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, 46/46. By an almost two to-one margin, 51/26, Florida voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate for U.S. Senate who supports strengthening gun laws, suggesting ample room for growth for gun safety candidates before the election next month. \\nThe poll was conducted by PPP the Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, and it illustrates the dilemma that the Florida Senate race has created for Democrats. Democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive Florida media, but there are polls that suggest that Sen. Marco Rubio\\u2019s Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy, has a chance of winning the seat. \\nIf Rep. Murphy can beat Sen. Rubio, the defeat would likely put an end to Rubio\\u2019s national political career or at least force the Florida Republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in 2020, and instead focus on a run for governor. \\nDemocrats have a real chance to send Marco Rubio to the unemployment line. Rubio has been a disinterested Senator, who just like Ted Cruz, seems only interest in his Senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions. Rubio has provided poor service to his constituents , and doesn\\u2019t deserve to return to the US Senate. \\nSen. Rubio has refused to commit to serving his full Senate term, which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them. \\nDemocrats have a chance to solidify their potential Senate majority by sending Marco Rubio home. With cash to spend and less than two weeks left in the campaign, they\\u2019d be foolish not to take it. \\nMarco Rubio Inches Closer To Unemployment As Poll Shows Florida Senate Race Tie added by Jason Easley on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016\", \"source_id\": 8910, \"article_id\": 323487}"
