According to the FBI, the classified e-mails included intelligence graded at the most closely guarded level: eight top-secret e-mails, and seven designated as \\u201cspecial access program\\u201d (SAP) information. (While FBI director James Comey\\u2019s presentation understandably left this vague, the likelihood is that seven of the eight top-secret e-mails are SAP.) Under President Bill Clinton\\u2019s 1995 executive order, top-secret intelligence is information the mishandling of which \\u201ccould be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.\\u201d The SAP designation is added when the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence could compromise critical intelligence-gathering methods or imperil the lives of intelligence sources. \\nThat is why access to this information is so tightly restricted, and its unauthorized disclosure is routinely prosecuted.\"}"
