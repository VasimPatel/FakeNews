"{\"content\": \"David Duke October 27, 2016 \\nToday Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery talked about Hillary\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s clear acts of treason against the United States by providing massive shipments of weapons to Saudi Arabia at a time that she knew they were providing support to ISIS. Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election. \\nDr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely. \\nThis is an extremely educating and enlightening show. Please share it widely.\", \"article_id\": 318407, \"title\": \"The David Duke Show: Hillary\\u2019s Treason and Why Trump & Duke Will Win\", \"source_id\": 3831}"
