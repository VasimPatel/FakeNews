"{\"title\": \"TRUMP CAMPAIGN being sued for humiliating Skittles candy by comparing it to Syrian Muslim infiltrators\", \"source_id\": 1087, \"article_id\": 315711, \"content\": \"TRUMP CAMPAIGN being sued for humiliating Skittles candy by comparing it to Syrian Muslim infiltrators It was a campaign ad that ignited a firestorm: Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a photo of a bowl of skittles and compared the colorful candy to Syrian jihadists posing as refugees. Now, the man who took the photo is suing Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence for copyright infringement. Liberals accused the tweet of being insenstive, racist, and a micro-agression which forced them to seek shelter in the nearest safe room. CBC David Kittos, an expert photographer and former Cypriot refugee, says he never gave permission and never would give permission for his photo to be used in the ad. \\u201cThe image, the way it was used is reprehensible,\\u201d said Kittos from his home in Surrey, England, in an interview with CBC News. \\u201cIt\\u2019s ignoring the plight of the refugees and it\\u2019s completely unacceptable that someone who was born into privilege would steal my picture and use it to make this political point.\\u201d Kittos says when he first saw the tweet, he was \\u201cin shock.\\u201d He explains he took the photo in 2010 as an experiment using artificial lighting and posted it on Flickr . \\u201cI just couldn\\u2019t believe my humble picture of some Skittles would just be used by someone so powerful.\\u201d Kittos says his lawyer reached out to the Trump campaign to discuss the matter but got no response. So he reported a copyright violation to Twitter, and about a week after it was posted his Skittles photo was removed from Trump Jr.\\u2019s tweet. Even though his photo is no longer connected to the ad, Kittos decided to file a lawsuit at a federal court in Illinois. He says he wants to ensure the Trump campaign never uses the work again. As well, he wants to spread the message that \\u201cthey can\\u2019t go around stealing from authors like myself. They\\u2019re not above the law.\\u201d The Trump campaign told CBC News it\\u2019s not commenting on the case at this time. Back in September, Trump Jr. defended the tweet. \\u201cI am surprised by the reaction simply because it is a metaphor for risk,\\u201d he said at a campaign stop in Boise, Idaho. Trump\\u2019s election campaign has called for \\u201cextreme vetting\\u201d of immigrants to the U.S., especially Muslims, to help weed out anyone who could be a danger to American citizens. While Trump\\u2019s position is popular with some Americans, his eldest son\\u2019s tweet ignited outrage on social media. \\u201cSorry kid. For all we know you could be a poisonous Skittle,\\u201d someone tweeted along with a well-known photo of an injured and bloodied young Syrian boy. \\u201cThe stupidity ensues,\\u201d commented another person. Even the Skittles owner, Mars, Inc., weighed in. \\u201cSkittles are candy. Refugees are people,\\u201d tweeted Denise Young, vice-president of corporate affairs. Kittos is seeking yet to be determined damages as part of the lawsuit. But he says he\\u2019s not in it for the money (sure he isn\\u2019t) and would have settled a for a public apology. Because that didn\\u2019t happen, he says he\\u2019s pursuing the lawsuit because \\u201cit\\u2019s the right thing to do.\\u201d\"}"
