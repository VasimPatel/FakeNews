In addition to all the chemicals that end up on your skin, when heated, the fumes are also toxic. These toxins go straight to their brain's most sensitive neurological centers and wreck havoc. 5 Killer Reasons to Ditch Dryer Sheets Artificial Fragrances When people use dryer sheets, they are coating their clothes with artificial chemical perfumes. These fragrance chemicals are extremely toxic. They are known carcinogens that cause liver damage and cancer in mammals. In a recent study performed by UW professor Dr. Anne Steinemann, a research team conducted a small study to understand the effects of fragrances in laundry products (both detergent and dryer sheets). The results discovered more than 25 VOCs emitted from dryer vents, with highest concentrations of acetaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol (two of which are considered carcinogenic). To put it into context, one of the carcinogenic VOCs, acetaldehyde, had emissions that would represent 3% of total acetaldehyde emissions from automobiles in the study area. This is a major omission of toxic chemicals. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and industry-generated Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) from the 1990s, the following is a list of chemicals in fabric softener products, most in untested combinations. 1. Alpha-Terpineol\\u2013This chemical has been linked to disorders of the brain and nervous system, loss of muscle control, depression, and headaches. 2. Benzyl acetate\\u2013Benzyl acetate has been linked to cancer of the pancreas. 3. Benzyl alcohol\\u2013This upper respiratory tract irritant can cause central nervous system (CNS) disorders, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and dramatic drops in blood pressure. 4. Chloroform\\u2013Neurotoxic, anesthetic and carcinogenic. Really toxic to your brain. Inhaling its vapors may cause loss of consciousness, nausea, headache, vomiting, and/or dizziness, drowsiness. 5. Ethanol\\u2013 Another fabric softener ingredient which is on the EPA's Hazardous Waste list and linked to CNS disorders. 6. Ethyl Acetate\\u2013causes headaches and is on the EPA Hazardous Waste list. 7. Linalool\\u2013in studies, this chemical caused loss of muscle coordination, nervous system and brain disorders, and depression. 8. Pentane\\u2013causes headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, drowsiness, and depression. What's the alternative to toxic dryer sheets? Wool balls. They are 100% natural and are effective at getting rid of static cling and wrinkles, soften clothes.\"}"
