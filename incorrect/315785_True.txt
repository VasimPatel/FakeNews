Then a third, in April, for 146 more. And a fourth, in June: 98. Three more notices followed, including 20 dismissals announced last week.\\nThe \\u201cplant\\u201d in question \\u2014 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\\nLike all big companies in New York State, the firm is required to file a \\u201cWARN notice\\u201d with state authorities when it plans to shed large numbers of employees as part of a plant closing, or \\u201cmass layoffs\\u201d involving 250 or more. Employers also must inform the state of smaller reductions under certain circumstances, and Goldman Sachs cited a \\u201cplant layoff\\u201d in each case. Last week\\u2019s notice brings this year\\u2019s job-cut tally to 443.With the run of notices, seven since the start of the year, the bank has signaled its intention to dismiss hundreds of employees in New York without placing a single, headline-grabbing number on the overall reduction, already its largest since 2008. The company\\u2019s approach differs from competitors, including Morgan Stanley, who have shown a preference for larger, one-time cuts.\\nBig Number\\n\\u201cWhen there\\u2019s a big number, people right away get that something is happening at that firm \\u2014 it\\u2019s a negative,\\u201d said Jeanne Branthover, a partner at New York-based executive-search firm DHR International. \\u201cThis is more, \\u2018We\\u2019re having layoffs and we don\\u2019t want to explain it.\\u2019 It\\u2019s more under the radar screen.\\u201d\\nThe 20 people in the latest reduction were notified either this month or last, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing staffing decisions. The terminations will take place between Nov. 7 and Jan. 5, according to the notice posted on the state Labor Department\\u2019s website. The workers aren\\u2019t represented by a union.\\nGena Palumbo, a managing director and the bank\\u2019s global head of employment law, is the sole Goldman Sachs contact listed on each of this year\\u2019s WARN notices. In 2008, the firm dismissed 900 people in New York in two different sets of cuts as the financial crisis raged. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.\\nGoldman Sachs set aside $9.2 billion for compensation and benefits this year through September, 13 percent less than the first nine months of last year. Total employees, including consultants and part-time workers, fell 5.4 percent to 34,900.\\nWhile Goldman prefers a scalpel, its rival Morgan Stanley wielded an ax. That firm took steps to shrink in the fourth quarter, cutting 1,200 employees, including about 25 percent of the fixed-income trading staff, or about 470 traders and salesmen. When asked about how Morgan Stanley decided to make the changes, trading chief Ted Pick said he favored a bold move.\\n\\u201cWe took the view of taking tough medicine,\\u201d Pick, 47, said in February.\\nSlower Approach\\nGoldman Sachs\\u2019s slower approach may reflect a desire to avoid cutting too much if trading or dealmaking comes roaring back. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein has spoken about staying nimble to respond to revenue opportunities when they arise.\\nIt also may reflect an outlook that got cloudier as the year progressed. In January, a person familiar with the firm\\u2019s thinking said Goldman Sachs was mulling cuts to more than 5 percent of its fixed-income staff. By March, that would expand to more than 5 percent but less than 10 percent. And by May, 10 percent.\\nThe job cuts continued after first-quarter revenue was the worst for the start of a year in Blankfein\\u2019s decade-long tenure. While trading business bounced back in the second and third quarters, total trading revenue for the first nine months declined 11 percent from last year.\\nThe WARN notices don\\u2019t capture firings outside New York and they don\\u2019t include voluntary retirements. More than a half-dozen partners have left Goldman Sachs this year, according to internal memos obtained by Bloomberg.\\n\\u201cEverything Goldman does is scrutinized,\\u201d Branthover said. \\u201cThis may be a signal or a sign that there are changes being made internally, or there are businesses and areas that are not performing satisfactorily. I would keep an eye on it.\\u201d\"}"
