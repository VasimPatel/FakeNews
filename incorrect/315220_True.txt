Tim Kaine cheered the demographic transformation of the United States caused by the nation\\u2019s federal immigration policies, telling his Latino audience on Thursday, \\u201cYou are the future of America.\\u201d \\n\\u201cBy 2050, communities of color will represent the majority of our population,\\u201d Kaine said. \\u201cSo, of course, Latinos will help shape the future of America because you are the future of America.\\u201d \\nAs the Pew Research Center has documented, this demographic transformation is largely the result of the changes to visa issuance policies enacted into law in 1965 that lifted the immigration controls put in place by Calvin Coolidge during the 1920s. {snip} \\n{snip} \\nYet during his remarks, Kaine laid out how a Clinton administration plans to hasten the demographic transformation through expansive immigration policies that would essentially bring about the dissolution of national borders . Kaine explained how a Clinton-Kaine administration would \\u201cend family detention,\\u201d \\u201cclose private detention facilities,\\u201d freeze deportations, and would give citizenship\\u2013and, by extension, voting privileges and access to federal benefits\\u2013to the illegal population. \\nKaine also doubled down on his pledge to expand President Obama\\u2019s executive amnesty: \\nA few months ago, the Supreme Court put DAPA on hold. That was devastating for millions of families. But it\\u2019s important to note that the Court didn\\u2019t actually rule on the substance of the case. Hillary and I have always said that DAPA is squarely within the President\\u2019s authority, and we will keep fighting for it. \\n{snip}\", \"source_id\": 583, \"article_id\": 315220}"
