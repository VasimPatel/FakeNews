"{\"content\": \"\\nVideo footage of a police chief being pulled over for traveling at speeds above 100 miles per hour was only released after one irritated citizen watched the top cop drive into the sunset without as much as a ticket.\\n\\nSome criminals are let off with a slap on the wrist, but one Arkansas police chief got off with a slap on the wrist for speeding, with responding officers laughing during the traffic stop.\\nBrinkley Police Department Chief Edward Randle was pulled over by a state trooper who had been called for assistance by a Brinkley police officer. However, any concern the trooper may have had quickly disappeared when he recognized Randle while approaching the truck.\\n\\u201c Where are you going so fast? \\u201d the trooper asked Randle, chuckling. Randle told the trooper that he was heading to \\u201c the game ,\\u201d a football game he was refereeing later that evening, KTHV reported .\\nWhen the Brinkley officer approached the vehicle, Randle proceeded to give him a hard time, saying: \\u201cI know you didn\\u2019t call the state police!\\u201d The officer explained that he did not announce the truck\\u2019s license plate into the reading, saying, \\u201c I didn\\u2019t have your plate, so it didn\\u2019t go over. \\u201d\\nThe only time the reason for Randle\\u2019s speeding was mentioned in the recording was when the state trooper told him, \\u201c I had you locked in at 107 [miles per hour]. \\u201d\\n\\u201c It won\\u2019t go over 95, \\u201d Randle replied.\\nRandle continued to defend himself using this argument, telling KTHV that the truck has a governor device on the engine that prevents it from going above 95 miles (153 km) per hour. However, the officer told Randle that he was driving 90 miles (145 km) per hour and was still only trailing Randle.\\nRandle denied going close to 95 miles per hour, he even denied the trooper\\u2019s comment that he had been driving \\u201c 71 (114 km) at the curve. \\u201d\\nThe confrontation ended quickly with all parties going their separate ways after a sum total of 45 seconds. The whole issue would have likely flown under the radar, had it not been for a citizen who witnessed it.\\nBenjamin Martin was leaving Clarendon, a nearby town, when he noticed the Brinkley police car in Clarendon city limits and pulled over to watch. What he saw troubled him, to say the least.\\n\\u201c I find it, you know, very disheartening, that anyone, public official or not, would show such blatant disregard for the speed limit, and put the lives of innocent others at risk, \\u201d Martin told KHTV, adding, \\u201c I just feel that no one\\u2019s above the law, and you know, if it was me, I would\\u2019ve gotten a ticket. \\u201d\\nMartin continued, \\u201c As a chief of police, and as a law enforcement officer, you\\u2019re sworn to protect and serve, which is the opposite of putting the lives of others at risk. \\u201d\\nHowever, Randle feels differently and claimed that after nearly three decades in law enforcement, he knows better than to put others at risk with dangerous driving.
