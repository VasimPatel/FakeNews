The bias is now being directed at the President-elect\\u2019s conservative appointments. \\nOn Monday night\\u2019s CBS Evening News, anchor Scott Pelley proclaimed that the Southern Poverty Law Center had declared that Donald J. Trump\\u2019s campaign CEO Stephen Bannon \\u201chas no business being in the White House.\\u201d Bannon was named as chief strategist and counselor. \\nIn fact, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has no business being cited as a credible source by any responsible news organization. It smears conservatives for profit, diverting attention from real domestic threats, such as the Marxist extremists currently demonstrating against Trump in the streets and threatening to disrupt his inauguration. \\nMany of the demonstrators are from the ANSWER Coalition , an outgrowth of the pro-North Korea Marxist-Leninist Workers World Party. \\nBut don\\u2019t expect to get any information about the ANSWER Coalition from the SPLC. \\nIn fact, the SPLC is in bed with communists of all kinds, having participated in the notorious Left Forum held in New York City earlier this year. We noted at the time that the event featured \\u201can assortment of communists, 9/11 truthers, pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activists, and other extremists.\\u201d \\nEven more troubling, SPLC President and CEO Richard Cohen was a member of the \\u201c Countering Violent Extremism Working Group \\u201d of the Department of Homeland Security in 2010. It is possible that Cohen, in this capacity, was able to get access to classified information, and that the SPLC, in turn, shared its erroneous data on conservative opponents of the Obama administration with federal law enforcement agencies. \\nThe attacks on Bannon stem from his leadership of the news site, Breitbart News , a popular source of alternative news and information which was strongly pro-Trump during the campaign. On occasion, the site features some unorthodox conservative views that Bannon\\u2019s critics have tried to pin on him. \\nThe site was named for Andrew Breitbart, who pioneered new and effective ways to undermine the left. One of his disciples, Jeremy Segal, did a video exposing Democratic Rep. Danny K. Davis (IL) being honored at the Communist Party U.S.A.\\u2019s headquarters in Chicago for a lifetime of \\u201cinspiring leadership.\\u201d \\nLazy liberal journalists would rather cite the SPLC as authoritative without having to bother to investigate how the group has been exposed by such investigative reporters on the left as Ken Silverstein. At one time, notes Silverstein , the group did some good work against racist hate groups. But later, in order to expand its business model and make more money, it expanded the \\u201chate\\u201d label to mainstream conservative organizations. It has accumulated $300 million in a reserve fund and has become \\u201cone of the most profitable charities in the country,\\u201d with its top officials getting membership in the so-called financial elite one percent. \\nThis journalist was named a member of the \\u201cradical right,\\u201d a designation then transformed into a charge of \\u201cIslamophobia\\u201d by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). The accusations are designed to silence First Amendment rights and discourage the media from going to conservative sources for news, information and commentary. \\nBefore Pelley uncritically cited the SPLC, Kate Snow was on MSNBC talking about how Trump\\u2019s stand against illegal immigration was similar to that of the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach. She said Kobach had given \\u201csupport\\u201d to the Social Contract Press, which she described as a \\u201chate group\\u201d designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center. \\nThe Social Contract Press rebuts all of the accusations, while noting that the SPLC\\u2019s $300 million cash hoard \\u201crivals that of [the] Clinton Foundation.\\u201d It was the Social Contract Press which published one of Silverstein\\u2019s articles exposing the SPLC. \\nIndeed, Silverstein\\u2019s expos\\u00e9 was just one section of a major report the Social Contract Press published in 2010 that examined the SPLC\\u2019s strategy and tactics. \\nYet, it\\u2019s Bannon who is being accused of being an extremist. The Washington Post admits there\\u2019s no real evidence behind the allegation, making it just another smear picked up by most of the media without adequate checking or verification. \\nWhat we are witnessing in the faux outrage against Bannon is a fear that the Trump administration and the new Republican Congress will get back to the business of monitoring real domestic threats. \\nFor example, Trump adviser Walid Phares has already indicated that the President-elect will back a bill, the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act, which could lead to an investigation of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \\nTrevor Loudon, the producer of the new film, \\u201c Enemies Within ,\\u201d says the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act could be supplemented by the House and Senate bringing back committees or subcommittees devoted to exposing internal security problems, also known as un-American activities. \\nA member of Congress exposed in the film for his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) , who is running for chairman of the Democratic National Committee.  \", \"source_id\": 6035, \"article_id\": 320603}"
