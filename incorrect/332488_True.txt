At some point, some entity will want to take possession of a big \\u201cchunk\\u201d of gold or silver and will stand for delivery of the physical with the intent to remove that gold or silver from Comex vaults. \\nFor now the big accumulators of physical gold (China, Russia, India) are content with the current rigged market price of gold as long as the west can continue to make deliveries into these countries.

It\\u2019s at that point when the precious metals market will become interesting. \\nThere is always the threat that the Shanghai Gold Exchange begins arbitraging out the price difference between the physical market (eastern hemisphere) and paper market (Comex, LBMA). Currentlysilver trades in China\\u2019s physical settlement market (Shanghai Futures Exchange) at a significant premium to the price on the COMEX paper market. The week of October 17, 2016 the average difference was well above $0.80 per ounce. This represents approximately a 45% difference. \\nHow large must the difference become before the physical market naturally overwhelms the paper market? The difference in the physical gold market is not quiet as dramatic as the physical silver market, but it seems a natural progression will occur in the not too distant future. \\nThe physical market is filled with people that are not interested in paper contracts. These people are in real markets located in the eastern hemisphere \\u2013 China, India and other countries. In these countries gold is either part of the culture or there is an understanding of gold\\u2019s role as a currency. \\nIn today\\u2019s episode with GATA/LeMetropolecafe.com\\u2019s Bill \\u201cMidas\\u201d Murphy about the extreme intervention in the precious metals market and the catalysts that will eventually override the Central Bank intervention.
