Sadly, Sessions did not recover his train of thought regarding Coulter\\u2019s article, but immediately began to talk about immigration, which more than made up for the loss. \\nI think he must be the very best Senator. So noble and sincere. And the fact that he reads Ann Coulter adds to his charm.\"}"
