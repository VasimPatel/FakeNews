"{\"article_id\": 346018, \"title\": \"Obama Defends Transgender Directive for School Bathrooms\", \"content\": \"{\\\"WASHINGTON \\u2014President Obamaon Monday made an impassioned argument for his administration\\u2019s decision to instruct public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, saying that society must protect the dignity and safety of vulnerable children.\\\",\\\"The remarks were the president\\u2019s first public comments on a directive released Friday that has added fuel to a searing national debate over transgender rights. Mr. Obama said the guidance, issued by the Education and Justice Departments, represented \\u201cour best judgment\\u201d on how to help schools wrestling with the issue.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe\\u2019re talking about kids, and anybody who\\u2019s been in school, been in high school, who\\u2019s been a parent, I think should realize that kids who are sometimes in the minority \\u2014 kids who have a different sexual orientation or are transgender \\u2014 are subject to a lot of bullying, potentially they are vulnerable,\\u201d Mr. Obama said in aninterviewwith BuzzFeed News. \\u201cI think that it is part of our obligation as a society to make sure that everybody is treated fairly, and our kids are all loved, and that they\\u2019re protected and that their dignity is affirmed.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The White House has said little about Mr. Obama\\u2019s role in the release of the guidance, which had been under development for months, other than to say that he had been kept apprised of its progress and that it was broadly consistent with his values. It has drawn condemnations from many Republican lawmakers who call it an example of presidential overreach.\\\",\\\"Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, said on Monday that the guidance violated the principle of separation of powers, and state officials there have signaled that they will seek to challenge it in court.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe president is turning the Constitution on its head,\\u201d Mr. Abbott told Fox News. \\u201cHe\\u2019s trying to cram down as many parts of his liberal agenda on the United States of America as he possibly can\\u201d before leaving office in January.\\\",\\\"The clash comes as the Obama administration is battling North Carolina over a law that says transgender people must use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their sex at birth. The Justice Department sued the state this month, arguing that the law is discriminatory.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no denying that there has been a significant uptick in public consideration of these kinds of questions\\u201d because of North Carolina\\u2019s measure, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Monday, before the president\\u2019s comments were published online.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe White House was not just aware of these policy deliberations but in the loop as the decisions were being made to ensure that the guidance reflected the president\\u2019s values and the president\\u2019s preferences,\\u201d he added.\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama said he would not comment on the North Carolina suit, to avoid intervening in a pending case. But he said that he expected the courts to eventually resolve the issue of how schools should treat transgender students, and that, in the meantime, his administration wanted to respond to inquiries from schools on how to proceed.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe said, \\u2018It is our view that you should try to treat these kids with dignity,\\u2019 \\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that the administration had sought to help educators and administrators by including a set of \\u201cbest practices\\u201d from school districts that have enacted similar transgender policies. \\u201cThere are school districts who have been wrestling with this problem and have, we think, done a good job in accommodating them in a way that is good for everybody, and so you can learn from these best practices. This is what we are advising.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But the directive represents more than just a suggestion. While it does not carry the force of law, it signals how the administration interprets federal statutes, bringing with it an implied threat that schools that act otherwise could lose federal funding.\\\",\\\"\\u201cUltimately, depending on how these other lawsuits go, courts will affirm or reject how we see the issue,\\u201d Mr. Obama said.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
