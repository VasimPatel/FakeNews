"{\"title\": \"Study: Rich People Less Likely to Be Interested In Your Face\", \"content\": \"Get short URL 0 24 0 0 A new study finds (perhaps unsurprisingly) that the wealthy do not pay attention to others, perceiving them as holding less \\u201cmotivational relevance.\\\" \\nUsing Google Glass, a hands-free wearable computer designed to look like eyeglasses, New York University researchers sought to track the eye movements of 61 New Yorkers who were instructed to look at whatever caught their attention while walking down the street.

This yielded the same outcome. \\nA third study showed 400 participants computer images and found that wealthier people took longer to notices changes in facial expressions. \\\"This finding suggests that social class, like other forms of culture\\u2026 can shape human cognitive functioning at a deep level,\\\" they wrote. ...\", \"source_id\": 18135, \"article_id\": 332764}"
