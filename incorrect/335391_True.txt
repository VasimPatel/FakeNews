It was previously discovered that Abedin had been archiving her email account from her work at the State Department on her personal email account, although the reason why is unclear. \\nMore from Zero Hedge: \\n\\nWe first laid what was the most likely explanation yesterday, when we showed several examples of Huma Abedin emails being sent from her work email account to her personal account at humaabedin@yahoo.com, courtesy of a Judicial Watch FOIA release. Of the more than 160 emails in the latest Judicial Watch release, some 110 emails \\u2013 two-thirds of the total \\u2013 were forwarded by Abedin to two personal addresses she controlled. The Washington Times reported in August 2015 that the State Department had admitted to a federal judge that Abedin and Mills used personal email accounts to conduct government business in addition to Clinton\\u2019s private clintonemail.com to transact State Department business. \\n\\nOne email from May 15, 2009, was sent by Abedin from her State Department email to her personal email. Abedin was archiving in her personal email account an email Hillary Clinton sent her from Clinton\\u2019s private email server at HDR22@clintonemail.com. Abedin was asked to print out attachments to an email Mills sent via a private address the previous day to Clinton involving \\u201ctimetables and deliverables\\u201d for her review via Alec Ross, a technology policy expert who then held the title of senior adviser for innovation to Secretary Clinton. \\n\\nHowever, while forwarding Hillary\\u2019s emails to her personal email server for \\u201cconvenience\\u201d is one thing, what is more troubling is the amount of redaction involved in these emails which migrated to the open email account, which as we now know ended up in Anthony Weiner\\u2019s computer: in the above example, the two pages of timetables and deliverables attached to the email were 100 percent redacted, with \\u201cPAGE DENIED\\u201d stamped across the first redacted page. \\n\\nAt this point it\\u2019s impossible to know why Abedin did what she did; however, the fact that FBI reopened this case this close to the election let\\u2019s us know there\\u2019s something seriously, seriously wrong with this entire ordeal. \\nThis is more proof that she is CROOKED, and should be tried for treason! \\n\"}"
