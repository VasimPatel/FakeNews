Reno\\u2019s goddaughter Gabrielle D\\u2019Alemberte and sister Margaret Hurchalla confirmed her passing to NPR. \\nReno spent her final days at home in Miami surrounded by family and friends, D\\u2019Alemberte told The Associated Press. She was 78. \\nReno served longer in the job than anyone had in 150 years. And her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy. But she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments. \\nShe was not President Bill Clinton\\u2019s first choice to head the Justice Department, nor his second. But after his No. 1 pick went down in confirmation flames, and his second choice also proved controversial, Clinton finally turned to Reno. \\nShe was an unexpected pick. She had no connections to Clinton or Washington. But Clinton wanted a woman, and Reno was a big-time prosecutor, holding the top prosecutor\\u2019s job in Miami-Dade County, a position she had been elected to four times over 15 years. \\nJamie Gorelick, who would later become deputy attorney general, was assigned to prep Reno for her confirmation hearing. \\u201cShe was the least air-brushed candidate we have ever had for a Cabinet-level position,\\u201d says Gorelick. \\u201cShe was herself, and she didn\\u2019t change herself for Washington.\\u201d \\nReno arrived at the Justice Department knowing no one, and was immediately plunged into the siege at the Branch Davidian compound outside Waco, Texas. Four federal agents had been killed and 16 wounded while serving a warrant to search for illegal guns. Seven weeks into the siege, pressed by the FBI, Reno authorized a raid on the compound, resulting in 76 deaths, including as many as 25 children and the Davidian leader David Koresh, who ordered his followers to set fire to the compound. \\nIn two sets of Waco congressional hearings over the next two years, Reno would successfully quell critics on the right and left. \\n\\u201cWhat haunted me,\\u201d Reno explained at one hearing, \\u201cwas that if I did not go in, I might be sitting there 10 days [later] \\u2026 when [Koresh] came out with explosives, blew himself, some agents and the entire place up.\\u201d \\nYears later, however, in an interview with NPR shortly before leaving office, her regret was palpable. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll never know whether it was a mistake or not, in one sense,\\u201d Reno admitted. \\u201cBut knowing what I do, I would not do it again. I would try to figure another way.\\u201d \\n\\u201cWaco didn\\u2019t make her hesitant: It made her insistent about getting her own information,\\u201d observes Walter Dellinger, who served in two top Justice Department jobs under Reno. \\nDellinger believes, for instance, that it may have been the Waco experience that led Reno to go personally to Miami in April 2000 to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of 6-year-old Cuban refugee Eli\\u00e1n Gonz\\u00e1lez from the home of a great-uncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent, in Cuba. \\nEli\\u00e1n had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the United States. Rescued by fishermen and brought to the U.S., he was soon turned over to his great-uncle. The Cuban community in Miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father, who lived in Cuba, and the furor soon bled over to Congress. \\nBut when negotiations with the great-uncle failed, armed federal agents, acting on Reno\\u2019s orders, raided the home, removed Eli\\u00e1n, and turned him over to his father, who had come to the U.S. to receive his son. When the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene, the two returned to their home in Cuba. \\nJanet Reno takes the oath as attorney general during a ceremony at the White House on March 12, 1993, while President Bill Clinton watches. \\nBarry Thumma/AP \\nOver the course of time, Reno would become embroiled in many controversies. She sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow Cabinet members and President Clinton himself. But she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaign after Justice Department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president. \\nThe decision so infuriated Republicans that some called for her impeachment. \\u201cThis is the most politicized Justice Department in the history of the United States,\\u201d railed Dan Burton, the Republican chairman of a key House oversight committee. \\nAt 6 feet 2 inches, however, Reno stood tall in the political crosswinds. Gorelick observes that when members of Congress, like Burton, were unhappy with a government official, they threatened to call that official to testify. But Reno, who had served as a staffer in the Florida state Legislature, always said, \\u201cFine, I\\u2019ll be there.\\u201d As a result, says Gorelick, \\u201ceventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that, because she prevailed in every outing that I can recall \\u2014 she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her.\\u201d \\nThe controversies that the Justice Department faced during Reno\\u2019s reign often eclipsed the many things that went well: the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers, for example; the pursuit of bombers of women\\u2019s health clinics that provide abortions; and the solving of the so-called Unabomber case. \\nAfter nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit, the FBI still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the Unabomber, who had killed three people and injured 23. Then, in 1995, the bomber sent a letter to The New York Times offering to cease his terror campaign if the Times or the Washington Post would publish his 35,000-word manifesto against modern industry and technology. Neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially, but Reno, the daughter of two newspaper journalists, persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety. \\nIt paid off. The Unabomber\\u2019s brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the FBI, ending the bomber\\u2019s long reign of terror. Theodore Kaczynski, aka the Unabomber, is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison. \\nIn 1995 Reno was diagnosed with Parkinson\\u2019s disease. She did not slow down, but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing. She even joked about the disease, claiming that \\u201cshaking sometimes helps,\\u201d as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak. \\nThat combination of toughness and self-deprecating humor, plus her determination to protect the Justice Department from improper influence, made her a hero to many who worked for her. \\n\\u201cJanet Reno led with her values,\\u201d says former Deputy Attorney General Gorelick, the department\\u2019s No. 2 official. \\u201cAnd that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do, the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her. \\u2026 I\\u2019d never seen that before in quite the same way.\\u201d \\nFlorida gubernatorial candidate and former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno speaks at the Florida Democratic Party State Conference on April 13, 2002, in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. She lost the Democratic primary. \\nReno won enormous respect inside the department as well, because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the Justice Department \\u2014 from national security, to environmental questions, to the generally obscure field of Indian law. \\nU.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called her \\u201cone of the most effective, decisive and well-respected-leaders in [the department\\u2019s] proud history\\u201d who \\u201cnever shied from criticism or shirked responsibility.\\u201d And former Attorney General Eric Holder said that \\u201cin a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain, Janet Reno stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values.\\u201d \\nFormer Solicitor General Dellinger believes that Reno was prepared for the attorney general\\u2019s job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height. \\u201cThis is a woman that went to Cornell and Harvard Law School at a time when very few women went to Harvard Law School, went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart \\u2026 and that\\u2019s really, really tough.\\u201d \\nThere were, of course, ups and downs in the eight years of Reno\\u2019s reign. But she said she always took the long view of her job. \\n\\u201cIf the end brings me out right, what people said about me won\\u2019t make any difference, and if the end brings me out wrong, 10 angels saying I was right won\\u2019t make any difference,\\u201d she said in an interview with NPR in 1997. \\nPresident Clinton made little secret of his frequent displeasure with Reno and the wall of separation she erected between the Justice Department and the White House. Still, he never asked her to resign. Reno was the last Cabinet member he reappointed after his re-election in 1996. \\n\\u201cIt was actually quite wonderful,\\u201d said Dellinger. \\u201cShe just decided to stay, and it turns out that nobody could fire her.\\u201d \\nThe tension between Clinton and his attorney general was apparent even as Clinton\\u2019s time in office drew to a close. In an interview with CBS News\\u2019 60 Minutes , Clinton went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike, but when it came to his evaluation of Reno, he was tepid, to say the least. \\n\\u201cGood woman,\\u201d he said. \\u201cTried really hard to do a good job. She\\u2019s a good person.\\u201d \\n\\u201cAt least he didn\\u2019t say I was a bad person,\\u201d replied Reno, with a laugh. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take what I can get!\\u201d \\nIndeed, by the end of her tenure, Janet Reno had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian Will Ferrell\\u2019s parody of her became one of the iconic skits on NBC\\u2019s Saturday Night Live . The recurring skit was inspired by reports that Reno had cut quite a figure dancing at a Justice Department party. \\nOn the last episode of the \\u201cJanet Reno\\u2019s Dance Party\\u201d parody, Ferrell, wearing a blue dress and pearls, reminisces about past glories and laments that the end of the party is near. Then, suddenly, the real Janet Reno comes crashing through the wall of the set, wearing the same blue dress and pearls as Ferrell, to deliver one of Ferrell\\u2019s signature lines: \\u201cIt\\u2019s Reno Time!\\u201d \\n\\u201cOh, Janet,\\u201d he says to the real Reno, as he mourns the end of the skit\\u2019s run, \\u201cwhat do you do when you get sad?\\u201d \\n\\u201cI just dance,\\u201d Reno replies, commanding the orchestra, \\u201cNow, hit it!\\u201d as she breaks out her best moves to \\u201cTwist and Shout.\\u201d It was her last day in office.\", \"source_id\": 683, \"article_id\": 315312}"
