"{\"title\": \"NYPD Catches Itself Selling Stolen Goods, Blames Business Owner\", \"content\": \"\\nby Carey Wedler\\nA business owner in Manhattan is suing the city after being forced to waive his Fourth Amendment rights and potentially forfeit his business because an NYPD officer sold illegal goods at his store.\\nYou read that right.\\nAccording to a lawsuit filed this month by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian legal advocacy group, an undercover NYPD detective attempted to sell stolen electronics to customers at Sung Cho\\u2019s laundromat in Inwood, which located near the northern tip of Manhattan, in 2013. After the officer successfully sold stolen goods to two people \\u2014 one inside the store and one outside \\u2014 the city threatened Cho with eviction \\u201cmerely because a \\u2018stolen property\\u2019 offense had happened at his business,\\u201d the legal organization\\u2019s website explained .\\nInstitute for Justice (IJ), which takes on cases involving the suppression of free speech, eminent domain, and civil asset forfeiture, among other government encroachments, detailed Cho\\u2019s case:\\n\\u201cThe city presented Sung with a choice: See his business shut down or sign an agreement giving up constitutional rights\\u2014including his Fourth Amendment right to be free from warrantless searches of his business. Faced with the imminent closure of his laundromat, Sung had no real choice but to sign.\\u201d\\nUnder the city\\u2019s decades-old \\u201cnuisance eviction ordinance,\\u201d residents and business owners can be evicted simply because an illegal act occurred on or near their property. Though the law was passed in the 1970s to target businesses that encourage illegal activity, like many laws, it has been abused.\\n\\u201cUnder the ordinance, the identity of the criminal offender is irrelevant,\\u201d IJ explains. \\u201cYou can be evicted because a total stranger (or a friend or family member) decided your home or business was a good place to commit a crime.\\u201d \\nAccording to IJ, \\u201cin many cases, the \\u2018proof\\u2019 of the alleged criminal offense is an affidavit from an NYPD officer relaying vague allegations from unnamed confidential informants.\\u201d \\n\\nA joint investigation by ProPublica and the New York Daily News reported that in Cho\\u2019s case, \\u201cthe police claimed in court filings that [his] business was facilitating an illegal fencing operation\\u201d because the undercover detective sold illegal goods there in 2013.\\nNone of Cho\\u2019s employees were ever accused of or charged with a crime.\\nNevertheless, in cases like Cho\\u2019s, the city often offers to drop the charges \\u2014 but only if the defendant agrees to relinquish their constitutional rights. Some \\u201care forced to sign agreements waiving their Fourth Amendment rights,\\u201d IJ explains.\\nAccording to ProPublica and the Daily News :\\n\\u201cCho agreed to give up his right to a hearing before being fined and agreeing to be shut down if police accuse anybody at his shop of breaking the law in the future. He also must allow the police to search his business and access his security footage at any time. The terms continue in perpetuity, and pass on to any new buyer or partner in Cho\\u2019s business, which he said makes it essentially worthless.\\u201d\\n\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t really defend myself, that\\u2019s why we had to settle prior to going to the judge,\\u201d Cho said. \\u201cJust because it happened nearby, under the law I am guilty, and that is not right.\\u201c\\nThe ordinance is being abused in other ways, as well. As IJ explains:\\n\\u201cOthers are forced to sign agreements barring family members from the home\\u2014including family members who have not been accused of any crime\\u201d\\nThis was the case of Jameelah El-Shabazz, also represented in IJ\\u2019s suit, who was forced to ban her son from her home. She was required to do so after he was falsely accused of possessing 45 cups of cocaine during a police search of a bedroom at her residence in 2011. Laboratory tests proved her son did not have cocaine or any other narcotic; she says the powder the NYPD found was crushed eggshells he uses for spiritual rituals.\\nThough no charges were ever pressed, \\u201cfour months later, she was served with the nuisance case and an order forcing her from her apartment while the case was being decided,\\u201d ProPublica and the New York Daily News reported.\\nShe says that when she signed the agreement, she had no idea it meant she had to permanently ban her son from her home.\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to make my son homeless because of the false accusations,\\u201d she said.\\nThe ProPublica/Daily News investigation reports that of over 1,100 cases in which these notices were issued during 2013 and the first half of 2014, fewer than half of the individuals targeted had actually committed a crime. They reported the cases occurred \\u201calmost exclusively\\u201d in black and Latino communities.\\nIJ\\u2019s suit follows another similar lawsuit concerning a woman who was evicted from her home for four days after police claimed drugs were illegally sold there. As it turned out, those engaging in illegal activity had moved out eight months prior. Though Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to the lawsuit, saying he believes everyone is entitled to a fair trial, city attorney Nicholas Ciapetta claimed in a recent motion that the woman \\u201cwas not entitled to any additional process.\\u201d The city\\u2019s law department said it has not yet seen IJ\\u2019s new case filing.\\nThough the NYPD has amended its use of the ordinance to restrict full closures on homes while nuisance cases are still being decided, they continue to endorse the law. \\u201cThis is one of many important tools we use as part of precision policing to continue to drive down crime and protect the public,\\u201d Police Commissioner James P. O\\u2019Neill said .\\nBut Cho disagrees. \\u201cIt\\u2019s unfair,\\u201d he asserted . \\u201cUnfair to me, unfair to all the investment that I made here, unfair to the employees that work here and support their families\\u2026it\\u2019s New York City versus a little guy like me.\\u201d \\nRobert Johnson, the lead attorney on the case representing Cho, El-Shabazz, and one other individual, strongly objected to the practice. \\u201cThe mere fact that someone\\u2019s been arrested is just not a reason why they should be kicked out of an apartment,\\u201d he said. The case was filed in the United States Court for the Southern District of New York.\\nJohnson said IJ is prepared to take the case against the \\u201ccoercively obtained\\u201d settlements all the way to the Supreme Court. If they win, \\u201cpast waivers of constitutional rights will be declared unenforceable and, going forward, this practice will be put to an end once and for all.\\u201d Delivered by The Daily Sheeple \\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ). \\nContributed by The Anti-Media of theantimedia.org . \\nThe \\u201cAnti\\u201d in our name does not mean we are against the media, we are simply against the current mainstream paradigm.
