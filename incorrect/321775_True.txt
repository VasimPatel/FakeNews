MAM is associated with the Aquila Group, Switzerland\\u2019s largest independent asset management group. \\nWhy Gold & Why GoldSwitzerland \\u2013 There are times in history when protecting your wealth should be the primary objective of your investment strategy. As Mark Twain said: \\u201cI am more concerned about the return of my money than the return on my money.\\u201d To preserve wealth in a fragile financial system, involves investing in assets which have no counterparty risk. Gold is not an investment, it is real money. Gold reflects governments ongoing deceitful action in destroying the value of paper money. Matterhorn Asset Management (MAM) has invested in physical gold for clients for over 10 years. Back in 2002 we advised our investors to buy physical gold for up to 50% of their financial assets. The image shows how in 1913 you could buy nearly 50 oz of gold for $1,000 and today only 0.75 oz. Thus against real money \\u2013 GOLD \\u2013 the dollar has declined 98% since the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the USA in 1913. But it is not only the dollar that has declined in value, all major currencies have lost 97-99% against gold since 1913. Until 1971 the US dollar was backed by gold. Since Nixon abolished the gold backing, money printing started in earnest and in the last 41 years the dollar lost 98% in real terms .
