Like all Democrats, Sally Kohn proves how little she thinks of women with this tweet\", \"source_id\": 20626, \"article_id\": 335207, \"content\": \"WE\\u2019RE NOT NASTY! Why does Sally Kohn hate women so much? Posted at 4:56 pm on October 27, 2016 by Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nSo tired of the notion that women have to be nasty to make a dent in this world, that women have to be hateful or mean to get things done. \\nWomen who do not live life as a caricature are fully capable of getting \\u201csh*t\\u201d done without having to be unkind, mean, disingenuous OR nasty. \\nAnd the fact that Sally Kohn and other Democrats don\\u2019t get this is just more evidence of how little they really think of women in general. \\nTake for example this tweet from Sally herself: \\n\\u2014 Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) October 27, 2016 \\nOh look a mom with her daughter instilling in her the same awful idea, that women have to be nasty to get something done. Trending The McAuliffe -- FBI -- Clinton payoff story just got a whole lot worse \\nStupid. Moms are fully capable of teaching their daughters how to get things done without being horrible. Of course that probably just confuses the Left but the stereotypical \\u201cME WOMAN ME ROAR\\u201d is ridiculous in the real world and most moms know this. \\nAwww, but then the Left doesn\\u2019t really live in the real world now do they? @sallykohn @RebeccaSoffer And exactly what has Hillary gotten done? \\n\\u2014 Calamity Jan (@janetbfitzgeral) October 27, 2016 \\nBesides set women back years with this nonsense about being nasty? \\nShe did leave four Americans to die in Benghazi and illegally keep a server in her home before deleting tens of thousands of emails, but we digress.\"}"
