Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didn\\u2019t work as expected. Enrollees\\u2019 health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizona\\u2019s insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases.   When Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces launched in fall 2013, Arizona seemed like a success. Eight insurers competed to sign up consumers, offering a wide variety of plans and some of the lowest premiums in the country. \\nToday, with ACA enrollment starting Nov. 1 , Arizonans will find in most counties only one insurer selling exchange plans for 2017. Premiums for some plans will be more than double this year, some of the biggest increases in the nation. Only last-minute maneuvering prevented one Arizona county from becoming the first in the nation to have no exchange insurers at all. \\nA similar dynamic is playing out in other states\\u2019 exchanges, which are a critical centerpiece of the 2010 health law. About one-third of U.S. counties will have just one exchange insurer next year , up from 7% this year, estimates the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health-care issues. In many cases, remaining insurers are seeking significant rate increases. Obama on Showing ACA Works: \\u2018We\\u2019re Not Going To Get That Much Help Through the Media\\u2019 \\nA look at what happened in Arizona shows the cascading effects of problems with the design and implementation of the ACA, combined with early missteps by insurers. Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didn\\u2019t work as expected. Enrollees\\u2019 health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizona\\u2019s insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases. \\n\\u201cThe Arizona market is the poster child for the problems the exchanges are experiencing nationally,\\u201d says Tom Snook, a Phoenix-based actuary for consultants Milliman Inc. \\nOpponents of the health law have cited the problems in Arizona and other states to argue for unraveling the legislation, and they have proposed changes such as expanding health-savings accounts and allowing insurers to sell plans across state lines. Trump: My employees are having problems with Obamacare \\nObama administration officials say they are bolstering the exchanges, and the consumer impact of premium increases will be limited by the law\\u2019s subsidies for lower-income people, received by about 85% of enrollees nationally. \\u201cWe\\u2019re making really good progress in addressing a lot of the issues,\\u201d says Kevin Counihan, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services unit charged with implementing the health law. He calls Arizona an \\u201coutlier,\\u201d saying that insurers elsewhere have succeeded with ACA plans. \\nThe ACA transformed the individual insurance market, where consumers buy their own plans. Before the law, insurers could refuse to sell to people with pre-existing health conditions. Starting in 2014, consumers couldn\\u2019t be denied coverage, or charged more, if they were ill. Individuals could shop for plans via an online marketplace. Partly to ensure that healthy people signed up to balance out the sick, the law contained penalties for most people if they didn\\u2019t obtain coverage. Arizona expanded Medicaid, as the law envisioned. \\nInsurers saw uncertainty in the new marketplace, but also potential. They had to guess what prices they needed to charge to cover the health costs of new enrollees. A 2013 Society of Actuaries report suggested that the Arizona individual-insurance market could more than double, growing to 570,681 consumers, with more than 80% of them buying through the exchange. The health-care costs of the newer customer base would be around 22% higher than the old one, it suggested. President dodges blame for Obamacare premium increases \\nInsurers believed they had protective guardrails \\u2014programs in the law to limit losses for companies that drew a lot of unhealthy, high-cost consumers. One insurer, Health Net Inc., told investors in November 2013 it could effectively pay out $1.20 in claims for each $1 it got in premiums and still break even with help from an ACA program called \\u201crisk corridors.\\u201d Some of Health Net\\u2019s Arizona products were among the lowest-priced in the country, according to Kaiser. \\nKim Walton, 62 years old, of Tempe, says his monthly insurance bill dropped by more than two-thirds compared with his pre-ACA plan, with help from a federal subsidy. Unlike his old plan, his new ACA insurance covered any costs tied to his pre-existing health conditions\\u2014he earlier had a hip replacement and suffered a broken neck. \\u201cIt was perfect,\\u201d says Mr. Walton, who owns his own business. \\nKrysti Horwitz of Phoenix steered clear of the exchange. Ms. Horwitz, 35, and her husband, who own an online-marketing business, were healthy. In 2013, they had a plan that she said cost them significantly less than a new ACA one would. They weren\\u2019t eligible for subsidies. They decided to keep what they had, an option the Obama administration authorized in late 2013. \\nBy spring of 2014, with the first year of the new ACA plans barely under way, insurers had to guess again at pricing. Rate requests for 2015 plans were due, though insurers still had scant information about who signed up. That was partly because federal officials extended the deadline for enrollment after technical problems with HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange being used in Arizona and many other states. \\nOne thing was already clear: Health Net\\u2019s low-price gambit had won huge market share. The company ended up with nearly 92,000 enrolled in individual plans in 2014, more than seven times its 2013 total, according to insurance-data firm Mark Farrah Associates\\u2019 Health Coverage Portal. \\nThat posed a challenge for rivals, including startup Meritus, one of the nonprofit cooperative plans launched under the ACA. Meritus drew only a few thousand consumers in 2014, and it needed to boost enrollment to sustain itself, according to Tom Zumtobel,the co-op\\u2019s former CEO, who took over in late 2014. \\nMeritus worked to reduce its prices, and its rates came in below competitors\\u2019 in 2015. \\nOnce again that year, Arizona had some of the lowest exchange premiums in the U.S., and one of the most competitive marketplaces, with 11 insurers, according to the Kaiser data. Enrollment grew, particularly at Meritus, where it surged to about 48,000 in 2015, according to Mark Farrah Associates. \\nOn Oct. 1, 2015, insurers got a huge blow: Federal regulators announced the risk-corridor program, which many companies expected to limit their financial risk, would pay out only 12.6% of the amount expected . The program hadn\\u2019t taken in enough money from successful insurers to cover the requests of those with significant losses. \\nFor Meritus, it was \\u201coperationally devastating,\\u201d says Mr. Zumtobel. That Oct. 30, just two days before consumers were set to start buying their 2016 exchange plans, Arizona\\u2019s regulator put the co-op under supervision, barring it from selling new insurance policies. \\nRemaining insurers began retrenching. The 2016 plans included more-limited networks of health-care providers. The total number of exchange insurers ticked down to eight, from 11, and premiums rose. \\u201cWe started to see the cracks,\\u201d says Jerry Anderson, an insurance agent in Scottsdale, Ariz. \\nNearly all the Arizona individual business of exchange insurers plunged into the red, according to Mark Farrah Associates, the insurance-data firm. Health Net booked nearly $40 million in losses on its Arizona individual business in 2014, and another $39 million the following year, according to Mark Farrah Associates, when the insurer agreed to be acquired by Centene Corp. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, the biggest player in the state\\u2019s individual market, had priced less aggressively than Health Net but still saw steep losses. \\nBased on regulatory filings, McKinsey & Co. estimated the insurance industry suffered cumulative losses of between 9% and 11% of premium revenue on individual plans last year. Only about one-quarter of insurers reported a profit on the business. \\nIn Arizona, insurers set their rates too low to cover their enrollees\\u2019 health expenses. There were fewer people than actuaries once projected, with about 203,000 choosing exchange plans during the enrollment period for this year. The share of enrollees who were healthy was smaller than companies projected, partly because the law\\u2019s penalties weren\\u2019t enough to prod them to enroll, insurers say. The unhealthy people who did sign up were more costly. Insurers say that some consumers appeared to be buying plans specifically when they had health needs. \\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona\\u2019s ACA plans in 2014 were priced around 35% higher on average than its individual plans in 2013. \\u201cIn hindsight, it wasn\\u2019t even close to enough,\\u201d says Jeff Stelnik, a senior vice president at the nonprofit. ACA-plan enrollees had medical costs around 250% higher on average than individual members before the health law, due partly to far higher prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, he says. \\nInsurers began to bail out. On April 19, UnitedHealth Group Inc. said it would pull out of nearly all state ACA exchanges , including Arizona\\u2019s, for the next year amid growing losses. Others in Arizona retreated, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and Health Net, which decided to pull out of the state\\u2019s most populous county, Maricopa, as well as adjacent Pinal, for 2017. On Aug. 15, Aetna Inc. announced it would leave most of its exchanges , including Arizona\\u2019s. Aetna\\u2019s decision created a crisis: Pinal County would have no exchange insurers for 2017. The void would short-circuit a central mechanism of the law, because consumers can get subsidies only through an ACA marketplace. \\nThe situation drew attention from Republicans critical of the ACA, including Arizona Sen. John McCain . He introduced a bill meant to \\u201cprotect AZ from Obamacare collapse,\\u201d according to a press release. Obama administration officials said they believed the situation would be resolved. \\nIn September, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona announced it would continue to sell exchange plans in Pinal next year after all. The decision came after state and federal regulators \\u201cexpressed their concern for Pinal residents,\\u201d though the insurer made the call on its own, says Blue Cross\\u2019s Mr. Stelnik. \\nNeighboring Maricopa County, the state\\u2019s most populous, also ended up with just one insurer\\u2014Centene, Health Net\\u2019s new parent, which announced Sept. 14 it would sell exchange plans there next year. Centene CEO Michael F. Neidorff says his company has a very different approach from Health Net, which he says \\u201cthought they would get the revenue, the growth,\\u201d and relied on ACA risk programs for protection. Centene said it expects to be profitable in Arizona, as it has been in other exchanges. \\nThat left only one county in Arizona, Pima, with more than one exchange insurer\\u2014it has two. There will be a few more options sold outside the exchange, to people who don\\u2019t get federal subsidies. \\nPremium increases are steep, though the effect will be blunted for those who get subsidies. Blue Cross\\u2019s rates are up by an average of 51% from this year, Centene\\u2019s Health Net unit\\u2019s, by nearly 75%. \\nMr. Walton, the consumer who benefited from lower premiums at the start of the exchange, worries he won\\u2019t be able to find a plan that includes his primary-care physician and his cardiologist. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going to happen come November,\\u201d he says.  \", \"source_id\": 8438, \"article_id\": 322997}"
