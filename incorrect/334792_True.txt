The \\\"Where We Are on TV\\\" report looked at diversity in broadcast, cable and streaming services for the 2016-17 television season. The report found a total of 278 LGBTQ regular and recurring characters across all platforms, the highest since GLAAD started tracking such numbers 20 years ago. GLAAD'S president is quoted in a report by Reuters saying, \\n\\\"While it is heartening to see progress being made in LGBTQ representation on television, it\\u2019s important to remember that numbers are only part of the story, and we must continue the push for more diverse and intricate portrayals of the LGBTQ community,\\\" GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. \\nAlso this year, Charisma News reported on a survey conducted by The Barna Group of Republicans and Democrats asking them whether Hollywood is biased against Christianity. It found that 32 percent of Republicans, and 5 percent of Democrats, believe that Hollywood generally portrays Christianity in a negative way. The article pointed out that over a decade ago, actress Jennifer O'Neill said, \\n\\\"If you mention the name Jesus Christ in Hollywood, all hell breaks loose.\\\" \\n\\nSo, where are we now? The portrayal of Christian characters is minimal and extremely misrepresented to fit specific agendas. As a result, faith based outlets appear to be independently rising not relying on mainstream media to \\\"define\\\" who they are.
