"{\"title\": \"De Blasio administration finds a way to ruin food trucks\", \"content\": \"New York Post \\u2013 by Michael Gartland \\nThe de Blasio administration is trying to limit the number of food trucks in the city by claiming that each hot-dog and kabob cart causes more pollution than a truck ride to Los Angeles. \\nDeputy Health Commissioner Corinne Schiff made the claim at a City Council hearing Wednesday, in an apparent effort to sink a bill that would nearly double the number of food-vendor permits in the city by 2023. \\n\\u201cMeat grilling is a significant source of air pollution in the city,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cOne additional vendor grilling meat emits an amount of particle pollution in one day equivalent to what a diesel truck emits driving 3,500 miles.\\u201d \\nThe new bill would boost the number of permits to 8,000 by 2023 and also create an enforcement team to sniff out violations. \\nSince 1983, the number of street-food vending permits has remained steady at 4,235. But there are likely more carts than that on the streets, as some vendors simply open shop without a license and work until they are caught. \\nSchiff argued any increase in the number of food carts needs to come with regulations stipulating that the carts operate in a more environmentally friendly manner. \\nCity Councilman Mark Levine (D-Manhattan), who is sponsoring the bill to increase the permits, wondered if this was already the case. \\u201cWe have laws in the city about air quality that currently stipulate that any food establishment has got to have a hood over a grill,\\u201d Levine said. \\u201cIs that not currently the law?\\u201d \\nSchiff, however, said there are no such laws regulating the carts as she suggested the proposals be delayed to ensure better pollution safeguards. \\n\\u201cWe really see this as an opportunity to work with the council to think through how we might use this modernization act to improve air quality,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe current laws don\\u2019t actually control the emissions that we\\u2019re concerned about.\\u201d \\nBusiness-improvement districts and residents throughout the city also pushed for delays on increasing vendor permits, saying there are too many already in some neighborhoods, but welcomed increased enforcement. \\n\\u201cThe enforcement idea is a great idea,\\u201d said Ellen Baer, co-chair of the NYC BID Association. \\u201cLet\\u2019s see if this works, let\\u2019s see how it works, let\\u2019s see if it\\u2019s sufficiently funded, let\\u2019s see how many resources they need \\u2014 before we start adding to the chaos.\\u201d \\nBut street vendors argued they\\u2019ve waited too long for reforms that would allow them to transition from operating illegally to legally. \\nSean Basinski, director of the Street Vendor Project, described the bills as \\u201cfar from our dream,\\u201d but said he supports most of what they call for. \\n\\u201cIt is a reasonable compromise,\\u201d he said. \\u201cVendors have been waiting 35 years for this change . . . We certainly welcome a study being done, but we don\\u2019t think that should delay the progress that needs to be made. The time for reform is now.\\u201d \\nBefore the hearing, some vendors rallied outside, demanding that city officials and police stop harassing them and treating them like criminals. \\nThe bill will remain before the committee while members discuss possible changes.\", \"source_id\": 5308, \"article_id\": 319924}"
