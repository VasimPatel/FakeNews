"{\"title\": \"Campaign Money Tests Wisconsin Justices\\u2019 Impartiality\", \"content\": \"{\\\"MADISON, Wis. \\u2014  In an off year for major elections in Wisconsin, one race in 2011 unexpectedly turned into a full-blown battle: David Prosser, a Supreme Court justice seen as part of the court\\u2019s conservative majority, was fighting for his seat against a more liberal opponent, JoAnne Kloppenburg, a little-known assistant attorney general.\\\",\\\"The campaign becamea referendum on effortsby the newly elected Republican governor,Scott Walker, to cut collective bargaining rights for most public workers, and money was pouring in. By the end, the Supreme Court race cost $5.7 million, including about $4.3 million in so-called issue ads paid for by outside groups. Justice Prosser defeated Ms. Kloppenburg by7,004 votes, a result so close thata recount was conductedat taxpayer expense.\\\",\\\"In the coming weeks, that outside campaign spending may be at issue again as the State Supreme Court considers whether an investigation can proceed intoclaims that Mr. Walker\\u2019s campaign improperly coordinatedthe spending by conservative groups during campaigns in 2011 and 2012 to recall him and state lawmakers after the collective bargaining cuts.\\\",\\\"Several of the same outside groups that were accused of coordinating with Mr. Walker in the recall electionspreviously spent millions of dollarsbacking Justice Prosser, a former Republican state lawmaker, and his conservative colleagues in recent elections, according to an analysis by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan group, though some of the outside groups dispute those findings.\\\",\\\"Now, acourt docket entry shows, a special prosecutor who has led the investigation into the recall campaigns is asking that at least one justice, not named in publicly available documents, recuse himself or herself from the case because of potential conflicts. Legal experts say they suspect that the court\\u2019s four conservatives have been asked to step aside in the case.\\\",\\\"The case highlights how a rising tide of money in state judicial races is creating potential conflicts for judges who sit on cases involving donors. Judges in the highest courts in 38 states face some type of election, and in the 2011-12 election cycle, the latest for which data is available, more than $56 million was spent on those races, nearly twice as much as in the 1990s, according toJustice at Stake, a nonpartisan research group.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt boggles the mind that these justices are saying that they can somehow be impartial when these parties to the case have been essentially stuffing their pockets with huge wads of cash,\\u201d said Matt Rothschild, the executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.\\\",\\\"Whether any justices recuse themselves could also have major implications for Mr. Walker, who is taking steps toward running for president in 2016. Though a lawyer for the special prosecutorhas saidthe governor is not a target, the investigation could cloud his national campaign if the court allows it to continue.\\\",\\\"A spokeswoman for Mr. Walker declined to comment on the issue, noting that it is part of a continuing legal matter.\\\",\\\"In an interview, Justice Prosser declined to discuss the Walker campaign case, but spoke generally of the factors involved in making a recusal decision, including the timetable of contributions in support of a judge\\u2019s campaign.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe effect of even large contributions can wear off after a reasonable amount of time has passed so long as it doesn\\u2019t involve a case that was pending at the time the contribution was made,\\u201d Justice Prosser said. \\u201cTiming is a very significant factor recognized by all legal experts.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The Wisconsin Supreme Court is officially nonpartisan, but has become polarized between four conservatives and three liberals. The group has reached moments of such intense personal antipathy that, as the justices were considering the future of Mr. Walker\\u2019s measure to cut collective bargaining rights, one accused another ofgrabbing her around the neck.\\\",\\\"Adding to the debate over judicial partisanship is astate measure,to be voted on next month, that would allow a majority of justices to select the chief justice, who for over a century has been chosen by seniority. The proposal, placed on the ballot by the Republican-held Legislature, is seen by Democrats as a partisan attack on the current chief justice,Shirley S. Abrahamson, viewed as part of the court\\u2019s liberal bloc.\\\",\\\"The investigation into whether Mr. Walker\\u2019s campaign worked inappropriately with conservative groups on a series of recall elections, including the governor\\u2019s own, began in August 2012 and has produced no charges.\\\",\\\"Many details are unknown publicly because of strict secrecy rules around the investigation, but prosecutors have suggested in documents that they were weighing whether disclosure rules and donation limits were violated as Mr. Walker\\u2019s allies directed activities of at least a dozen outside groups, including theWisconsin Club for Growth,Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce,and Citizens for a Strong America. Lawyers for some of the groups have said no laws were broken, in part, because the groups did not tell people directly how to vote.\\\",\\\"The investigation stalled more than a year ago when a state judge quashed subpoenas, saying he had found no probable cause of campaign finance violations. The Supreme Court had scheduled arguments for next month on the question of whether the investigation can proceed, but in an order issued late Friday took the unusual step of saying it would make a decision based on written briefs because the inquiry\\u2019s privacy rules made oral arguments \\u201cneither legally nor practically possible.\\u201d\\\",\\\"According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, some of those same groups have provided more than $8 million over the years to support Justices Prosser, Patience Roggensack, Annette Ziegler and Michael Gableman, mainly for issue ads that do not explicitly tell people to vote for a candidate, but which, the democracy campaign\\u2019s analysis says, clearly supported the conservative justices by advocating their stances or denouncing their opponents\\u2019 records.\\\",\\\"But some of the outside groups disputed the analysis and the amounts cited. Scott Manley, vice president of government relations for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state\\u2019s largest business group, said that the organization had spent money \\u201ceducating state residents on judicial policy issues that affect Wisconsin,\\u201d but added that \\u201cnone of these ads advocated a candidate\\u2019s election or defeat.\\u201d And Andrew M. Grossman, a lawyer with the firm BakerHostetler, representing the Wisconsin Club for Growth, said the group had \\u201cnever advocated for or against the election of any candidate.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Under a policy approved by the State Supreme Court in 2010, judges need not recuse themselves from a case \\u201cbased solely\\u201d on an endorsement, campaign contribution, independent expenditure or issue advocacy. In 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruledin a 5-to-4 decision involvinga West Virginia case that elected judges must disqualify themselves from cases involving people who spent exceptionally large sums to put them on the bench. Yet in 2010, the Supreme Court also provided broad latitude on outside spending in theCitizens Unitedcase.\\\",\\\"Wisconsin Supreme Court races once were relatively low-budget affairs in which the incumbents usually won re-election every 10 years. Intensity and spending increased in the last decade as outside groups pressed for and against candidates, leading some justices to call for a merit selection system. A new program for public financing of Supreme Court campaigns, approved in 2009, was dropped two years later.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt is night and day now to what it was then in terms of all this money coming in and the potential or actual conflicts that are arising on so many high-profile cases,\\u201d saidJanine Geske, a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice appointed by a Republican governor to fill a vacancy in the 1990s.\\\",\\\"Supporters of the court\\u2019s conservative bloc note that liberals on the court have received assistance from labor union members, even though the court has ruled on labor issues, including Mr. Walker\\u2019s plan to restrict collective bargaining. In a 2009 election, for instance, Justice Abrahamson received more than $100,000 from labor unions, the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign said, and theGreater Wisconsin Committee, a progressive group that gets support from labor, spent $465,000 on issue ads that backed her.\\\",\\\"While declining to discuss the case related to Mr. Walker, Justice Gableman said in an interview that he drew a line between contributions made directly to his campaign and independent spending by outside groups.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe rule that I operated under in my election was we coordinated with no one,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI view that as a world of difference from someone actually giving to my campaign money which is then up to the campaign and ultimately my discretion as to how to spend it. I have no say as a candidate over the third-party groups.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In Wisconsin, a justice who steps aside is not replaced by a substitute. Yet, the court must have at least four justices present to act on a case, so if four justices stepped aside, experts said, its fate would be uncertain.\\\",\\\"Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, seen as a member of the liberal wing, has already recused herself; her son works with a lawyer who represents a party in the case. Facing an election in April, she voiced concern about the role of big money in the race. She has said that she will not accept contributions from political parties, or from lawyers or groups with cases before the court.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI truly believe that partisan politics and out-of-state special interests have no place in our courtrooms,\\u201d Justice Bradley said in response to written questions.\\\",\\\"Yet her opponent, James Daley, a circuit court judge who has received an in-kind donation from the state\\u2019s Republican Party, said he viewed the notion that Justice Bradley shunned help from Democrats as \\u201ca giggle.\\u201d The issue, he added, was not what Wisconsin voters he had met along the campaign trail were most worried about.\\\",\\\"\\u201cPeople are, No. 1, concerned with the public displays of dysfunction in the court,\\u201d he said.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 338248}"
