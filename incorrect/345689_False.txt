"{\"article_id\": 345689, \"title\": \"For Mayor de Blasio, Police Dept. Is a Force to Be Reckoned With\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Early in the evening of April 19, a few hours aftera Brooklyn judge ruledthat the former police officer Peter Liang\\u2019s shooting of Akai Gurley in 2014 was essentially an accident for which a prison sentence was not deemed necessary, Constance Malcolm received a call in her Bronx apartment. On the other end of the line was Valerie Bell, the mother of Sean Bell, who waskilled by the policea decade ago outside a Queens nightclub, where he had been celebrating at his bachelor party. Four years ago, Ms. Malcolm\\u2019s son Ramarley Graham was shot and killed by a police officer, Richard Haste, in the company of several others, a few feet from where she was now standing. Her mother and her younger son, Chinnor Campbell, then 6, were at home when it happened.\\\",\\\"Tragedy has a habit of compelling its survivors toward a kind of obliterating inertia or relentless activism. Mr. Graham\\u2019s mother, Mr. Bell\\u2019s mother, Eric Garner\\u2019s mother and others who have lost children to the violence born of police prejudice or misjudgment have devoted themselves to calling for accountability and justice. Ms. Malcolm would say her own efforts had been largely fruitless. Despite therallies, news conferences and petitions\\u2014 Ms. Malcolm has appeared in front of City Hall three times in the past two months \\u2014 Officer Haste remains on the force, on modified duty. He, another officer and a sergeant faceinternal disciplinary chargespending an investigation, but Ms. Malcolm has not been able to find out what the charges against Officer Haste\\u2019s colleagues are, nor what will become of other officers who were on hand at the time of her son\\u2019s death, some of whom have not been publicly identified.\\\",\\\"When I posed these questions to theNew York Police Department, a spokesman, Lt. John Grimpel, responded in an irritated tone that he didn\\u2019t have to tell me.\\\",\\\"In terms of transparency and accountability, the administration of MayorBill de Blasio, Ms. Malcolm remarked to me, \\u201cis just as bad as Giuliani\\u2019s and Bloomberg\\u2019s.\\u201d The requests she has made to meet with Mr. de Blasio since he took office have been denied. The mayor did, however, meet with the retired tennis star James Blake only days after Mr. Blake was thrown to the ground by a plainclothes officer who had mistaken him for someone else.\\\",\\\"After her son was killed, Ms. Malcolm, who works in a nursing home in Westchester, remained largely out of commission for a year. \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t function,\\u201d she said. In the aftermath of the shooting, her son Chinnor, who was seated next to her when I visited, had difficulty sleeping and trouble in school. \\u201cThe teacher was calling all the time,\\u201d Ms. Malcolm said. Chinnor kept running out of the classroom; eventually he transferred to a new school. For two years she wouldn\\u2019t let him play outside; the prospect worried her too much. \\u201cI tried to watch TV and get out of my mind,\\u201d Chinnor told me. After a while, Ms. Malcolm got him a dog. Her daughter, who had originally planned to go the Police Academy, decided against it. Instead, she started making caps with the image of two hands up that read, \\u201cDon\\u2019t Shoot.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, begins his bid for re-election next year, he will almost certainly be challenged on his record of police reform. As long as a culture in which obfuscation is regarded as an entitlement continues to dominate the department, he is vulnerable to the accusation that little has changed. When the Legal Aid Society sued New York City for access to records pertaining to Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who put Eric Garner in theillegal chokehold that killed him, and a judge ruled in the organization\\u2019s favor, the city did not graciously turn over the keys to the file cabinet but instead appealed.\\\",\\\"What effect will all of this have on the mayor\\u2019s base of support? Last year, Councilman Andy King, a Bronx Democrat who represents the district where Mr. Graham was killed, spoke favorably of the mayorin an interview with The New York Observer. In February, at a rally outside City Hall at which Ms. Malcolm urged the mayor to have Officer Haste fired, Mr. King led a chant of \\u201cNo hope, No vote,\\u201d implying that the electorate should cast its votes elsewhere if Mr. de Blasio failed to act.\\\",\\\"At the same time, activists, particularly those who are part of the Police Reform Organizing Project, hold regular rallies in protest of what they view as the status quo problems of broken-windows policing. Despite the drastic declines in the use ofstop-and-frisktactics under the de Blasio administration, the group argues that bias reigns. A report that the group released in March said that in 1,880 cases recorded in criminal courts in Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, from June 3, 2014, to March 18, 2016, 91 percent of the defendants were minorities.\\\",\\\"Add to this the widely circulated video of a black postal worker, Glen Grays,handcuffed and carted awaywhile he was working in Brooklyn, for no apparent reason, and the marketing of successful police reform becomes an even greater political challenge. (Within a month after the Grays episode, the Queens district attorney\\u2019s office announced it was indicting two detectives accused of assaulting another uniformed Postal Service employee.) Many voters are unlikely to pay much attention to the complicated, and arguably politically motivated, fund-raising scandals currently plaguing City Hall. But images of abuse and rank unfairness they get.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
