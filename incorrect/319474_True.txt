McGrew \\nIn the year 4874, an ancient document was unearthed. It described how the consciousness of the inhabitants of the earth changed from evil to goodness approximately 3,000 years ago. \\nWe have translated this to our best ability. \\nAnd it came to pass, that the world was ruled by an evil Queen. A foul stench was laid upon the peoples of the earth. \\nShe gave the land of her people to foreigners, taking away their power. And the foreigners were arrogant with their stolen gains. They offended the citizens. \\nAnd the Queen gave the industries of her citizens to foreigners. And the foreigners were arrogant, hiring only their own kind and displacing the citizens. And the foreigners brought with them, the lazy of their families. The thieves and the liars and the most vile in the families of the foreigners, ruled over the citizens. \\nAnd to the worst of the worst, in the foreigner\\u2019s families, were given unto them, the fruits of the citizens\\u2019 labor, while the evil Queen laughed down at the citizens. \\nAnd the citizens were homeless in their own villages. And the citizens were insulted and violated at will by the foreigners. \\nThe people had only one thing of value left to them that was impossible for the evil Queen to take from them: Their faith. The people prayed. \\nThe people in the village of the Queen prayed. And they sent messages, as a bird tweeting, to the villages nearby and those villages sent messages to the villages nearby and those people sent messages to the villages nearby, until the whole world knew to pray for a savior. And the whole world prayed for a savior. \\nAnd it came to pass, after generations, that there was a savior, being prepared, being trained to defeat the evil Queen. And the people prayed harder and longer and more loving, now to protect their young savior and to guide him in righteousness. \\nAnd one day, when the Queen was addressing her citizens, a violent wind came from the north, blowing her pantsuit away and the people saw her secrets. And she became known for her true self. \\nThe evil Queen tried to punish the wind and it came again, exposing her generals and she swore to conquer the wind. She ordered all of her people to not feel the wind, to deny it existed. And the wind grew harder and became stronger again. \\nAnd the wind blew over all parts of the earth and cried out to all good men, \\u201cJoin me!\\u201d. And the people joined. From village to village across all the lands, they joined. \\nAnd on a dark windy night, the people were all joined in a field and the crowd was all of the good and right thinking people of the earth and it was quiet. \\nA lone voice cried out, \\u201cHe is coming!\\u201d and he pointed to a star in the heavens. And the people saw that he was coming. On his left was a red angel and on his right was a green angel to guide and protect him. And the people saw that he was coming. They prayed for his safety. \\nThey huddled together in fear as they felt the power of his chariot coming from the sky. \\nHis chariot stopped in front of the multitudes and he spoke to them. They were calmed. They were excited. They knew him. They had seen him before without knowing his true purpose. And now, standing amongst them, he was unveiled and the people liked what they saw and what they were hearing. After generations of lie upon lie sent upon their lives, he spoke the truth. And the people were amazed at his truths. \\nAnd in the back of the crowd of people, several mountain ranges away, it was difficult to hear him and the people in the back whispered to the ones in front of them, \\u201cWhat does he say?\\u201d. And those people asked the people in front of them, \\u201cWhat did He say?\\u201d. And those people asked and the asking continued to the front of the crowd. And one man answered back in a whisper to the people behind him and those people whispered to the ones behind them, the words that were spoken by their savior and the whisper turned into a voice and the voice became a shout and the shout became a great noise and the great noise became like thunder echoing across all the lands of the earth, the words of the savior, \\u201cLOCK HER UP, LOCK HER UP, LOCK HER UP!!!\\u201d \\nAnd the people knew there was a savior standing before them. And they cheered and they cried with joy, knowing that their prayers had been answered. \\nAnd he told them, before he departed in his chariot, \\u201cYou must help. You must work. You must spread my words to all.\\u201d \\nWhen his chariot, with the green angel on his right and his red angel on his left began to leave, the people heard and felt the power of his wings and the people felt the warmth of his love. And the people in the back of the multitudes saw his chariot go into the Heavens, from where it had come. And the people believed him because he told them to believe in their own righteous honor. He did not say they were deplorable and irredeemable. \\nAnd the people did work and they did spread his word. And through the word of the people, the evil Queen\\u2019s soldiers lost faith and they refused to fight the people again. And the words of the savior, being repeated by the people, caused the most trusted of the evil Queen\\u2019s advisers to flee. And all of her servants fled. All the evil people of the Queen hurried to escape the people. They hid in their caves and in the forests. And she was left alone, with only her drink. And she drank. \\nAnd she drank until she was in such a stupor that the people quietly entered her palace and removed her. \\nAnd the foreigners were driven out of the lands and permitted to take nothing with them. \\nWhen all was prepared and the savior knew his people were righteous, He came back and one by one, he drained the swamp, eliminating the corrupt politicians and the corrupt lawyers and the corrupt jesters and all the corruption was destroyed. There was much destruction and much death at the hands of the savior, for he was savior only to the good and the honest and the just of this world. \\nThe ungood, the dishonest and the unjust were sent away and prohibited from annoying the people anymore and the savior ignored them and let them die in their own time in their own way. And they died in very short time, because the people would not give them work, or food, or shelter or rest. \\nAnd he told the people, \\u201cNow you must work, and work hard, to rebuild your lives and rebuild your fortunes and to care for your children, and teach them my words and teach them my actions, for someday I must leave you.\\u201d \\nAnd for a great time, there were no wars on the earth, for most of the leaders of nations had seen that the savior was a good man, an honest man and a just man. And they came from all parts of the earth to make peace with him. \\nAnd the leaders who did not hear his words and see his actions and learn from them were destroyed. And there was peace for 1,000 years, until this was written and evil does not exist anymore. Rate this:\"}"
