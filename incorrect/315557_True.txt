And we will start celebrating America. We will be united by our common culture, values and principles, becoming one American nation, one country, under one Constitution, saluting one American flag, and always saluting it,\\u201d Trump said. \\nLast year a Denver-area school board sought to change the content of the AP U.S. history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism. \\nThat sparked a political proxy war in Jefferson County, Colorado, and the 2015 school board election drew nearly $1 million in campaign funding from outside interest groups. \\nPublic schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding. \\nCurrent federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising \\u201cany direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 987, \"article_id\": 315557}"
