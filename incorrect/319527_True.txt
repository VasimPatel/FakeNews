(See \\u201c Remarkable resemblance of Sandy Hook victims and professional crisis actors \\u201c) \\nLocated in Denver, Colorado, a business that calls itself VisionBox Crisis Actors provides professionals (\\u201ctrained players and actors\\u201d) who impersonate real-life people in simulations of mass casualty events, such as government drills, shootings and bombings, to help \\u201cschools and first responders create realistic drills, full-scale exercises, high-fidelity simulations, and interactive 3D films.\\u201d As an Oct. 31, 2012 feature story on the Crisis Actors website which I found on January 1, 2013, once boasted: \\nA new group of actors is now available nationwide for active shooter drills and mall shooting full-scale exercises, announced Visionbox, Denver\\u2019s leading professional actors studio. \\nVisionbox Crisis Actors are trained in criminal and victim behavior, and bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places. \\nThe actors\\u2019 stage acting experience , ranging from Shakespeare to contemporary American theater, enables them to \\u201cstay in character\\u201d throughout an exercise, and improvise scenes of extreme stress while strictly following official exercise scenarios. [\\u2026] \\nVisionbox Crisis Actors can also play the role of citizens calling 911 or mall management, or posting comments on social media websites. \\nFor more, see my post \\u201c Professional crisis actors simulate mass casualty events \\u201c. \\nCuriously, since the phenomenon of crisis actors was uncovered after the Sandy Hook false-flag, crisis actors seem to have gone underground. VisionBox revised its website, removing any mention of crisis actors. But this video that was uploaded to YouTube on Dec. 23, 2012, says the same things about VisionBox which I had reported: \\nProfessor James Tracy also recently discovered that Crisisactors.org , the website established to represent the collaboration between the Visionbox professional actors studio and FEMA\\u2019s Emergency Management Institute , went dormant after August 2014. (See \\u201c Where Have All the Crisis Actors Gone? \\u201c) \\nTo add to the insanity, there are even amputee crisis actors, such as those from a business called Amputees in Action , which provides \\u201ctrained professional amputee actors\\u201d who promise to \\u201cremain in character\\u201d\\u201cfor the film and screen industries and for emergency and military services training simulations\\u201d with \\u201cspecial effects (SFX) make-up, moulage and prosthetic artists use cutting edge technology to enhance and extend the appearance and function of limb-loss scenarios.\\u201d (For more, see my post \\u201c Did you know there are AMPUTEE crisis actors? \\u201c) \\nAlleged victim of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, Jeff Bauman, is an example of an amputee crisis actor. See the reasons why in \\u201c Hollywood producer Nathan Folks says Boston Bombing\\u2019s a false flag \\u201d. \\nNow add fake political protests and protesters to the things that crisis actors do. \\nJamie Taete reports for Vice , Aug. 6, 2013, that Crowds on Demand is a company that will organize a crowd for you, on demand. The crowd can be fake fans for some celebrity or aspiring celebrity, or fake protesters for a cause. \\nSince the company\\u2019s fake fan events are \\u201csuper secret,\\u201d Taete attended instead \\u201ca fake protest\\u201d called \\u201cPurge Day USA\\u201d (to purge mental health problems) which the company organized in Los Angeles \\u201cin coordination with a charity\\u201d to \\u201craise awareness about mental health issues\\u201d. Here\\u2019s a photo of the fake protesters: \\nCrowds on Demand\\u2019s founder and CEO Adam Swart said that there were about 20 protesters at the fake protest and all of them were \\u201cprovided by me\\u201d. The fake protesters were paid $15 an hour. Swart charges \\u201ca couple thousand dollars\\u201d to organize a fake protest with about 20 actors, but he gives discounts to charities. \\nTo critics who say Crowds on Demand is unethical, Swart , who is only 24 years old , openly and brazenly admits: \\u201cIs it misleading? Yes. That\\u2019s the idea.\\u201d \\nA more recent example of fake protesters is an ad on Craig\\u2019s List soliciting actors to impersonate protesters at Trump rallies. \\nAs reported by ZeroHedge on March 30, 2016, the ad was placed by \\u201cI\\u2019m feelin\\u2019 the Bern\\u201d Bernie Sanders supporters who promise to provide shuttle buses, parking, and protest signs, as well as $15/hour to the actors. Here\\u2019s a screenshot of the Craig\\u2019s List ad: \\nThe above ad has since been removed by its author , but the Daily Caller points out the ad is part of a recurring pattern of anti-Trump Craigslist ads soliciting and paying people to protest at Trump rallies. But Daily Caller claims that the fake protesters are hired not by Sanders, but by Hillary Clinton\\u2019s people, and paid for by the usual suspects George Soros, MoveOn.org, and Progressive Auto Insurance \\u2018s Jonathan Lewis : \\nThe Establishment on both the left and the right, who want to disenfranchise the millions of Republican voters who support Donald Trump, have blamed the staged riots near Trump rallies on Trump or on Bernie Sanders. That\\u2019s like blaming the Russians for the Reichstag Fire. Bernie has little to do with these manufactured protests. This is a Clinton operation, a faux protest. \\nFalse flag operations have long been common in politics, but these riots are poisonous to the electorate, intentionally designed to turn violent and stifle free speech. \\nThis free speech-busting goon squad operation is directed by supporters of Hillary Clinton. It is paid for mostly by George Soros and MoveOn.org and pushed by David Brock at Media Matters for America. It\\u2019s also funded by reclusive billionaire Jonathan Lewis, who was identified by the Miami New Times as a \\u201cmystery man.\\u201d He inherited roughly a billion dollars from his father Peter Lewis (founder of Progressive Insurance Company). \\nA march and demonstration against Trump at Trump Tower essentially fizzled Saturday when only 500 \\u201cprotesters\\u201d of the promised 5000 showed up. Infiltrating the crowd, I learned most were from MoveOn or the Occupy movement. Soap was definitely in short supply in this crowd. Several admitted answering a Craig\\u2019s list ad paying $16.00 an hour for protesters. \\nHillary understands that Trump would lose the votes of certain establishment Republicans if he were the nominee. On the other hand, it doesn\\u2019t matter, because of his crossover outreach. In Michigan, Democrats and independents who have lost their jobs because of disastrous globalist trade deals like NAFTA are lining up to vote for Donald. \\nAnd so, when you see an anti-Trump protest or another mass shooting, don\\u2019t believe your eyes. The \\u201cprotesters\\u201d and \\u201cvictims\\u201d\\u2014 including amputees! \\u2014 you see may just be acting. \\n~Eowyn\", \"source_id\": 4893, \"article_id\": 319527}"
