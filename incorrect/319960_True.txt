"{\"title\": \"Hillary Clinton Tops \\\"Islamist Money in Politics\\\" List\", \"content\": \"Hillary Clinton Tops \\\"Islamist Money in Politics\\\" List   \\nThere are some very dubious awards out there that you just don't want to win. Being one of the top recipients of Islamic money in politics certainly tops that list. Hillary Clinton likes to complain about dark money. This is as dark as money gets. As the Middle East Forum's research shows . \\nHillary Clinton tops the list, raking in $41,165 from prominent Islamists. This includes $19,249 from senior officials of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates on November 15, 2014. \\nFor example, Mrs. Clinton has accepted $3,900 from former CAIR vice-chairman Ahmad Al-Akhras, who has defended numerous Islamists in Ohio indicted \\u2013 and later convicted \\u2013 on terrorism charges. \\nAmong other current presidential candidates, Jill Stein has accepted $250. Donald Trump and Gary Johnson have not received any Islamist money. \\nOther top recent recipients of money from the enemy include Rep. Keith Ellison ($17,370) and Rep. Andre Carson ($13,225). \\nThe top ten list includes nine Democrats, one independent (Sen. Bernie Sanders accepted $9,285), and no Republicans. \\nI don't think that's too surprising to anyone. Though you have to feel sorry for Jill Stein. She hates Israel and announced she wouldn't have killed Osama bin Laden. What's a girl gotta do to get ahead on Jihad Street anyway?\", \"source_id\": 5408, \"article_id\": 319960}"
