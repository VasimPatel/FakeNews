"{\"title\": \"Juror in Oregon militia trial dismissed for bias: judge\", \"content\": \"Reuters \\nA juror in the trial of seven militia members charged with seizing a U.S. wildlife refuge in Oregon at gunpoint earlier this year was dismissed for bias, a federal judge said on Wednesday. \\nProsecutors and defense attorneys in the case agreed to the dismissal of the juror, who formerly worked for the federal Bureau of Land Management, after U.S. District Judge Anna Brown said the juror would be questioned more closely about comments he may have made about his bias. \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a new jury, a new day, a new start,\\u201d Brown said. \\nBrown said deliberations by the jury would start over. An alternate will step in for the dismissed juror. \\nThe attorney for Ammon Bundy, the leader of those charged, asked the court in a motion on Wednesday morning to dismiss the juror in question and order the jury to begin deliberations again or declare a mistrial. \\nThe jury\\u2019s integrity came under scrutiny on Tuesday when it sent the judge a letter saying one juror admitted being \\u201cvery biased\\u201d as deliberations began last week. \\n\\u201cCan a juror, a former employee of the Bureau of Land Management, who opens their remarks in deliberations by stating \\u2018I am very biased \\u2026\\u2019 be considered an impartial judge in this case?\\u2019 the letter stated, according to the motion by Bundy\\u2019s lawyer, Marcus Mumford. \\nWhile it was unclear whether the supposed bias of the juror, identified as Juror No. 11, was for or against the government, Mumford had said further questioning of the person was needed. \\nBrown interviewed the juror in private on Tuesday and said she found \\u201cno basis\\u201d for determining he was biased. Prosecutors had previously opposed additional interrogation of the jury.\", \"source_id\": 5308, \"article_id\": 319852}"
