Macy\\u2019s slogan makes a handy title for the new exhibit, \\u201c Real American Places: Edward Weston & Leaves of Grass \\u201d at The Huntington Art Collections in San Marino, Calif. On view through March 2017, it includes roughly half of the 49 photos chosen for the ill-fated edition. \\n\\u201cWeston never explicitly said he was going to illustrate Whitman,\\u201d James Glisson, co-curator of the show with Jenny Watts, told Truthdig. \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t tell Macy until very far into the project.\\u201d \\nThe 54-year-old Weston was coming off a crowning career achievement the same year, the publication of \\u201c California and the West ,\\u201d financed through a Guggenheim Fellowship\\u2014the first awarded to a photographer. The book represented a departure for Weston, who until then was known primarily as a studio photographer. He had taken his first road trip, covering 23,000 miles with his lover of 10 years, Charis Wilson , 28 years his junior, who wrote the book\\u2019s highly praised text and became his second wife along the way. \\nBy May 1941, they were ready to do it again, loading up an eight-cylinder Ford dubbed Walt and setting off from Wildcat Hill, their sanctuary in Carmel, Calif. This journey would cover 20,000 miles through 24 states over eight months, with Macy shelling out for expenses up to $1,000 over six months, including printing and supplies. \\nTheir first significant stop was Boulder, Colo., where Weston photographed the Boulder (now Hoover) Dam. At a subsequent stop in Port Arthur, Texas, he captured more than a dozen frames of silvery spherical oil tanks. \\u201cCalifornia and the West\\u201d had featured natural landscapes, but man-made objects now took over his frame. \\nThe first progress report to reach Macy gave him a real fright. What did otherworldly globes in Texas have to do with Walt Whitman? In his original proposal, Macy requested that Weston \\u201cillustrate every other line in Whitman\\u2019s poetry,\\u201d which, taken literally, would require thousands of photos to match even half the images in the text. \\u201cI hope this is a job which you can tackle quickly,\\u201d he added without irony. \\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s very controlling,\\u201d said Watts, who pored through correspondence between the two. \\u201cHe comes in with very strong ideas of what he wants. He\\u2019s not very good at communicating it to the artist. Then he gets very horrified when something comes back that\\u2019s not what he had envisioned.\\u201d \\nAlthough Macy had run into creative differences with artist Henri Matisse while working on another masterpiece dense with illusion, James Joyce\\u2019s \\u201c Ulysses ,\\u201d it would be presumptuous to blame the publisher for the disagreement with Weston. Matisse hadn\\u2019t bothered to read the book, delivering drawings based on the Greek mythical character instead of Joyce\\u2019s text, for a price of $5,000. In Weston\\u2019s case, he \\u201cdidn\\u2019t give a hoot about \\u2018Leaves of Grass\\u2019\\u2014he was having the time of his life,\\u201d according to Wilson\\u2019s 1998 memoir, \\u201c Through Another Lens .\\u201d \\nWhitman is mentioned only five times in 230 pages of notes chronicling the journey. Weston explained himself this way: \\u201cMy plan for work on this commission was direct: I photographed anything and everything I saw which excited me. I could do no more. Since Whitman\\u2019s poems cover all walks of life, and every high- and byway, I couldn\\u2019t easily neglect him.\\u201d \\nThis gave him license to expand his parameters, photographing places and people he was seeing for the first time. Gone are the wide horizons of \\u201cCalifornia and the West,\\u201d replaced by works of man\\u2014a Louisiana church, a bottle farm in Ohio, the Brooklyn Bridge. Each is captured as an item on a list, ordered so as to tell a story, which is similar to how Whitman commonly structured his verse: \\n\\u201cI believe a leaf of grass is no less than a journeywork of the stars, And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren, And the tree-toad is a chef-d\\u2019ouvre for the highest \\u2026\\u201d \\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s this idea of movement and journey, one by foot, the other by car, that acts as a temporal element to what they\\u2019re doing,\\u201d Glisson said, completing the parallels between Weston and Whitman.\", \"source_id\": 20424, \"article_id\": 335032}"
