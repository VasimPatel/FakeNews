Donald Trump is on track to win more of the African-American vote than any other Republican in modern memory, said John Yob, CEO of a Michigan-based polling firm, Strategic National . And that\\u2019s why Barack Hussein Obama is running around campaigning so hard against him for Hillary. While that so-called \\u201cracist\\u201d Donald Trump along with Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali, were receiving the Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the National Ethnic Coalition Organization\\u2026 \\u2026Hillary Clinton was singing the praises of Democrat Senator Robert Byrd, former leader in the Ku Klux Klan before becoming a U.S. Senator. Breitbart On Friday, a poll of 506 Pennsylvania voters by Harper Polling showed Trump has the support of 18.46 percent of African-Americans. An Oct. 30 poll of 1,249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans, while another 7 percent remain undecided. That poll has a error margin of 2.77 percent. In next-door Michigan, two nights of a tracking poll conducted for Fox 2 of 1,150 likely voters showed Trump with 14 percent support and 19 percent support. That\\u2019s equivalent to a two-point shift from Clinton to Trump in the state. Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many African-American voters \\u2014 especially younger voters who backed Sen. Bernie Saunders \\u2014 distrust Clinton, said W ayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. That distrust has helped cause a sharp drop in the number of absentee ballots mailed in from Detroit, even as other part of the state send in more ballots that before, Bradley said. Faced with a low turnout, the Clinton campaign is trying to frighten African-Americans to vote, but \\u201ct hat\\u2019s not a convincing enough argument,\\u201d he said. Trump\\u2019s gain among African-American voters is happening in many states, alongside an overall reduction in African-American enthusiasm and support for Obama\\u2019s designated successor. That drop-off in support from Obama\\u2019s 93 percent level will likely reduce the turnout for Clinton. That\\u2019s a problem for Democrats, because a 7.5 percent drop in nationwide African-American turnout would be equal to a one-point drop in a nationwide vote for Clinton. Reports say the early-voting turnout by Africans Americans has dropped by up to 10 percent in North Carolina and by somewhat less in Florida . President Barack Obama and other top Democrats have hopscotched through the states to push that turnout back up by election day. But pollsters face problems when trying to gauge opinions in a high-stakes emotional competition. Some concerned people lie to pollsters. For example, roughly 7 percent of college grads hide their support for Trump when they\\u2019re ask by pollsters over the phone, perhaps out of fear of penalties if their choice was made public. So when polls show a non-answer from respondents, for example, many undecided voters, the votes may be hiding a weak or strong preference for Trump. These factor may be impacting polls of African-Americans, who are being hammered by claims from Clinton and Obama that Trump is supposedly a racist. \\u201cIf you accept the support of Klan sympathizers \\u2014 the Klan \\u2014 and hesitate when asked about that support, then you\\u2019ll tolerate that support when you\\u2019re in office,\\u201d Obama told an African-American crowd in North Carolina on Nov. 3. (See above for Hillary\\u2019s support of the KKK) A national poll by TIPP showed Clinton at only 75 percent support among all non-whites, including Hispanics, African-Americans and Latinos. That poll showed Trump getting support from 15 percent of non-whites , leaving 5 percent undecided and 5 percent supporting other candidates. Amid the disagreement, rivalries and complexity, Bradley is confident that Trump will do well among African-Americans. His final tally as the GOP candidate \\u201cwill be a higher number that it has been in the past\\u2026 [because] he\\u2019s working, he\\u2019s coming to these cities to deliver the message.\\u201d The African-American vote may even be enough to help push Trump over the so-called \\u201cblue wall\\u201d of Democratic northern states that stands in his path to the White House. Some say Trump is likely to get 16-25% of Black vote.\", \"article_id\": 315714}"
