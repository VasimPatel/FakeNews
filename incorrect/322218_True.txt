"{\"content\": \"Print \\nDonald J. Trump has slowly but surely improved his standing in state and national polls since the final presidential debate. \\nA New York Times Upshot/Siena poll released Sunday is consistent with that trend: It gives Mr. Trump a four-point lead in Florida, 46 percent to 42 percent, in a four-way race. In our first poll of Florida a month ago, Mr. Trump trailed Hillary Clinton by a percentage point. \\nThe survey is Mr. Trump\\u2019s best recent poll in Florida, and it should be interpreted with caution. In general, it is best to look at an average of polls. Mrs. Clinton still leads in an average of recent Florida surveys by nearly three points. \\nBut the poll is not the only one to show Mr. Trump in the lead. A Bloomberg/Selzer poll , which is methodologically similar to the New York Times Upshot/Siena poll, showed Mr. Trump with a two-point edge last week.\", \"source_id\": 7588, \"article_id\": 322218, \"title\": \"Latest poll shows Trump with 4-point lead in Florida\"}"
