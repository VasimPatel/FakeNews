Chad Underwood. Before capturing him, police had described Greene, who was last seen driving a blue Ford F-150 with an Iowa license plate, as armed and dangerous. \\nGreene was taken into custody by the Dallas County Sheriff\\u2019s Department while walking along a rural road in Redfield, about 35 miles west of where the shootings occurred. \\nAccording to police, Greene flagged down a passing Department of Natural Resources officer, handed over his ID and told the officer to call police. No shots were fired and there was no struggle, according to police. \\nThe suspect was taken by ambulance to a Des Moines hospital with an unknown injury. \\nIn a late morning news conference, police identified the slain officers as Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin and Des Moines police Sgt. Anthony \\u201cTony\\u201d Beminio. \\nThe attacks began around 1:06 a.m. CT, when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire at the intersection of 70th Street and Aurora Avenue in Urbandale. \\nThe first officers arriving on the scene found Martin fatally wounded. About 20 minutes later, some two miles away, Beminio was was shot near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Ave. while responding to reports of the first officer\\u2019s shooting. Beminio was transported to Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died.

Officer from Des Moines and another from Urbandale were shot and killed in their cars, @dmpolice said. #officersdown \\n\\u2014 Daniel P. Finney (@newsmanone) November 2, 2016 \\nDes Moines police, fearing officers were being singled out, paired up its patrol officers so none were on the street alone, Parizek said. \\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s literally a clear and present danger if you\\u2019re a police officer,\\u201d he said. \\nPolice did not offer many details on how investigators identified Greene as a suspect. Underwood said he was identified \\u201cthrough a series of leads and a series of investigative tips.\\u201d \\nAs of an early-morning news conference, police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers and planned to withhold the officers\\u2019 names, years of service and other details until later in the day, Parizek said. \\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the killings, saying \\u201cviolence has no place in the United States of America.\\u2019\\u2019 \\n\\u201cLet me be clear, there is no message in murder,\\u2019\\u2019 the attorney general said, referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country. \\u201cViolence creates nothing; it only destroys.\\u2019\\u2019 A Des Moines police officer was found fatally shot in a vehicle near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Avenue in Des Moines on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. (Photo: Brian Powers, The Des Moines Register) \\nIt\\u2019s the first time Des Moines has seen a police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in 1977. \\nTwo Des Moines officers, Susan Farrell and Carlos Puente-Morales, died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck head-on by a wrong-way drunk driver. \\nThe killing of the Urbandale officer appeared to be the city\\u2019s first for an officer shot in the line of duty, Underwood said at the news conference. \\nParizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost Farrell and Puente-Morales, as well as with this tragedy. \\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t even know where to begin on how bad this year is,\\u201d he said. But, \\u201cthis is what we do. We come in day in and day out, we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of what\\u2019s going on in our personal and professional lives.\\u201d Officers investigate the scene at Merle Hay and Sheridan ave. where an officer was found shot at about 1:26 A.M. on on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016, in Urbandale. \\nIn a statement, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad called the attack on the officers \\u201can attack on the public safety of all Iowans.\\u201d \\n\\u201cWe call on Iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOur thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harm\\u2019s way.\\u201d \\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst extended her thoughts and prayers to the families of the officers killed. \\n\\u201cAlthough the investigation is still unfolding, what appears to be an ambush attack of police in the line of duty is an attack on the community at large and all of the men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us,\\u201d Ernst said. \\u201cThis was a senseless act of violence and it cannot be tolerated.\\u201d \\nFinney and Haley report for The Des Moines Register.
