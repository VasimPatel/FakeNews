"{\"content\": \"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name => \\nDenouncing Russian air strikes on Aleppo as \\u201cbarbaric,\\u201d Mike Pence declared in Tuesday\\u2019s debate: \\n\\u201cThe provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. \\u2026 The United States of America should be prepared to use military force, to strike military targets of Bashar Assad regime.\\u201d \\nJohn McCain went further: \\n\\u201cThe U.S. \\u2026 must issue an ultimatum to Mr. Assad \\u2014 stop flying or lose your aircraft \\u2026 If Russia continues its indiscriminate bombing, we should make clear that we will take steps to hold its aircraft at greater risk.\\u201d \\nYet one gets the impression this is bluster and bluff. \\nPence has walked his warnings back. And there are few echoes of McCain\\u2019s hawkishness. Even Hillary Clinton\\u2019s call for a \\u201cno-fly zone\\u201d has been muted. \\nThe American people have no stomach for a new war in Syria. \\nNor does it make sense to expand our enemies list in that bleeding and broken country \\u2014 from ISIS and the al-Qaida-linked al-Nusra Front \\u2014 to Syria\\u2019s armed forces, Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. \\nThese last three have been battling to save Assad\\u2019s regime, because they see vital interests imperiled should it fall. \\nWe have not plunged into Syria, because we have no vital interest at risk in Syria. We have lived with the Assads since Richard Nixon went to Damascus. \\nPresident Obama, who has four months left in office, is not going to intervene. And Congress, which has the sole power to declare war, has never authorized a war on Syria. \\nObama would be committing an impeachable act if he started shooting down Russian or Syrian planes over Syrian territory. He might also be putting us on the escalator to World War III. \\nFor Russia has moved its S-400 anti-aircraft system into Syria to its air base near Latakia, and its S-300 system to its naval base at Tartus. \\nAs the rebels have no air force, that message is for us. \\nRussia is also moving its aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov, into the Med. Vladimir Putin is doubling down in Syria. \\nLast weekend, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned that U.S. attacks in Syria \\u201cwill lead to terrible tectonic consequences not only on the territory of this country but also in the region on the whole.\\u201d \\nTranslation: Attack Syria\\u2019s air force, and the war you Americans start could encompass the entire Middle East. \\nLast week, too, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, warned that creating a \\u201cno-fly zone\\u201d in Syria could mean war \\u2014 with Russia. Dunford\\u2019s crisp retort to Sen. Roger Wicker: \\n\\u201cRight now, senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia. That\\u2019s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I\\u2019m not going to make.\\u201d \\nAnd neither, thankfully, will Barack Obama. \\nSo, where are we, and how did we get here? \\nFive years ago, Obama declared that Assad must step down. Ignoring him, Assad went all out to crush the rebels, both those we backed and the Islamist terrorists. \\nObama then drew a \\u201cred line,\\u201d declaring that Assad\\u2019s use of chemical weapons would lead to U.S. strikes. But when Obama readied military action in 2013, Americans rose up and roared, \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\nReading the country right, Congress refused to authorize U.S. military action. Egg all over his face, Obama again backed down. \\nWhen Assad began losing the war, Putin stepped in to save his lone Arab ally, and swiftly reversed Assad\\u2019s fortunes. \\nNow, with 10,000 troops \\u2014 Syrian, Iraqi Shiite militia, Hezbollah, Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Afghan mercenaries \\u2014 poised to attack Aleppo, backed by Russian air power, Assad may be on the cusp of victory in the bloodiest and most decisive battle of the war. \\nAssad and his allies intend to end this war \\u2014 by winning it. \\nFor the U.S. to reverse his gains now, and effect his removal, would require the introduction of massive U.S. air power and U.S. troops, and congressional authorization for war in Syria. \\nThe time has come to recognize and accept reality. \\nWhile the U.S. and its Turkish, Kurdish and Sunni allies, working with the Assad coalition of Russia, Hezbollah and the Iranians, can crush ISIS and al-Qaida in Syria, we cannot defeat the Assad coalition \\u2014 not without risking a world war. \\nAnd Congress would never authorize such a war, nor would the American people sustain it. \\nAs of today, there is no possibility that the rebels we back could defeat ISIS and the al-Nusra Front, let alone bring down Bashar Assad and run the Russians, Hezbollah, Iran and the Iraqi Shiite militias out of Syria. \\nTime to stop the killing, stop the carnage, stop the war and get the best terms for peace we can get. For continuing this war, when the prospects of victory are nil, raises its own question of morality. \\n  \\nCopyright 2016 Creators.com.\", \"source_id\": 20746, \"article_id\": 335363, \"title\": \"ISIS, Not Russia, Is the Enemy in Syria\"}"
