"{\"title\": \"The Danger of Germany\\u2019s Current Account Surpluses\", \"content\": \"by Yves Smith \\nYves here. Germany seems determined to test the Eurozone experiment to destruction. As we\\u2019ve long said, it insists on contradictory aims: running large trade surpluses, not being willing to finance them, and not permitting high levels of fiscal spending to serve as another mechanism to provide for transfers to \\u201cdeficit\\u201d countries. By contrast, people in New York and California don\\u2019t even think much about the fact that they are getting less out of the Federal government than they pay in taxes and are effectiely supporting consumption in places like Mississippi. \\nBy Wouter den Haan, Professor of Economics and Co-Director of the Centre for Macroeconomics, London School of Economics; Martin Ellison, Professor of Economics at the University of Oxford; Ethan Ilzetzki, Assistant Professor, London School of Economics; Michael McMahon, Associate Professor of the Department of Economics, University of Warwick; and Ricardo Reis, A.W. Phillips Professor of Economics, LSE. Originally published at VoxEU \\nThe October 2016 expert survey of the Centre for Macroeconomics (CFM) and CEPR invited views from a panel of macroeconomists based across Europe on Germany\\u2019s trade surplus, its impact on the Eurozone economy, and the appropriate response of German fiscal policy. More than two-thirds of the respondents agree with the proposition that German current account surpluses are a threat to the Eurozone economy. A slightly smaller majority believe that the German government ought to increase public investment in response to the surpluses. \\nGermany posted a record-high current account surplus of 8.5% of GDP in 2015; indeed, the German surplus has overtaken China\\u2019s surplus as the largest in the world. Germany\\u2019s current account was slightly in deficit when the euro was created in the late 1990s, it steadily increased in the early 2000s and has continued to rise since the Global Crisis of 2008. Since 2010, the increase in the current account has been accompanied by fiscal surpluses, with the German government moving from a deficit of 4% of GDP in 2010 to a surplus of 1.2% in the first half of 2016. Global Imbalances \\nThrough the prism of the trade balance, the current account surplus can be viewed as a symptom of Germany\\u2019s economic success. German exports increased from 30% of GDP in 2000 to 47% in 2015. But with imports at merely 39% of GDP, this implies that Germany is providing capital to the rest of the world at a very high rate. Indeed, German savings have increased from roughly 20% to nearly 30% of GDP, while domestic investment has remained roughly constant at around 20% of GDP. \\nOne view, harking back to Keynes, is that such large capital flows could be very destabilising, particularly within a system of fixed exchange rates (or a currency union). The argument is that while countries with current account deficits may come under severe pressure to adjust, countries with surpluses face no corresponding pressures. 1 Keynes\\u2019s solution \\u2013 which was part of the inspiration for the creation of the IMF \\u2013 was that occasional exchange rate adjustments might be necessary in order to rebalance international credit flows. \\nA number of commentators have suggested that Germany\\u2019s large current account surpluses reflect such imbalances. Paul Krugman attributes the Eurozone crisis in part to Germany\\u2019s current account surplus. The capital flows that this current account financed dried up as the crisis unfolded. But the burden of the adjustment fell solely on the Eurozone periphery, which closed their current account deficits, without the aid of Germany where the current account has only increased. In this view, German fiscal surpluses are an international version of the paradox of thrift. 2 \\nThe IMF (2016) and the European Commission (2016) have both warned of the risks of Germany\\u2019s current account surpluses; and both have urged Germany to take actions to reduce its external surplus, for example, by increasing public investment. \\nWhile the nature of the Eurozone makes exchange rate adjustments impossible, the IMF reckons that Germany\\u2019s real exchange rate is now 15-20% undervalued (IMF 2016, p. 7). The US Treasury has gone so far as to add Germany to its \\u2018monitoring list\\u2019 of countries engaged in \\u2018unfair currency practices\\u2019, even though Germany does not have a national currency (US Treasury 2016). \\nIn contrast, Jens Weidmann, President of the Bundesbank, has argued that German net capital outflows are primarily structural, resulting from Germany\\u2019s high level of economic development and ageing population. He also argues that the Eurozone\\u2019s common monetary policy allowed slower current account adjustments, thus mitigating the Eurozone crisis (Weidmann 2014). The German economics ministry claims that Germany\\u2019s surplus is \\u201ca sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germany\\u201d. 3 \\nThe first question in the October 2016 expert survey of the Centre for Macroeconomics (CFM) and CEPR addressed the question of whether large German surpluses are reasons for concern. 4 To focus the question, we asked the experts about its consequences for the Eurozone, but they were free to address wider implications in their comments. \\nQ1: Do you agree that German current account surpluses are a threat to the Eurozone economy? \\n\\n\\nSixty-seven panel members answered this question and a large majority (69%) agree or strongly agree with the proposition. A number of panel members point to evidence of the risks of current account balances. Ricardo Reis (LSE), for example, says that \\u201ccurrent account imbalances during 2000-08 played a central role in the Eurozone crisis of 2010-12\\u201d (see Obstfeld 2012 and Lane 2013). \\nOther panel members suggest that German current account surpluses are a symptom of the common European currency. Michael Wickens (Cardiff Business School and University of York) warns that \\u201cthe main underlying problem is the single currency. Germany\\u2019s current account surplus reflects its competitiveness, but due to the single currency, it can\\u2019t appreciate against the Eurozone countries with chronic current account deficits. It is all reminiscent of the failures of the Bretton Woods system, which of course eventually collapsed due to currencies becoming misaligned.\\u201d \\nSimon Wren-Lewis (Oxford) agrees that \\u201cthe surplus represents an undervalued real exchange rate in Germany, which requires more inflation in Germany relative to the rest of the Eurozone\\u201d. \\nWouter Den Haan (LSE) suggests that the problem is exacerbated by conditions in the Eurozone periphery: \\u201cThere is a very good chance that the Eurozone is in a bad equilibrium in which consumers do not spend because they are concerned about future earnings and firms are hesitant to hire workers and raise wages because they are concerned about demand for their products. Even if this is not behind the high savings rate in Germany, it does make this increase in precautionary savings more problematic in the periphery.\\u201d \\nA number of panel members (Charles Bean, LSE; Jonathan Portes, National Institute of Economic and Social Research) warn that Germany\\u2019s current account surplus is not uniquely a Eurozone problem, but is also large enough to contribute to the low global real interest rates. \\nThe global dimension is also the main counter-argument of the panel members who think that the German current account is not a threat to Eurozone stability. Robert Kollman (Universit\\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles) points out that \\u201cthe German current account surpluses do not represent a threat to the Eurozone economy, because Germany trades more with the rest of the world than with the rest of the Eurozone\\u201d. \\nPietro Reichlin (Universit\\u00e0 LUISS G. Carli) caveats his concern about the German current account with the view that \\u201cpart of the surplus is due to exports to extra-European countries and these benefit some EU peripheral economies that are exporting intermediate inputs and parts to Germany\\u201d. \\nOthers do not feel that there are theoretical grounds for concern about the German current account. Francesco Lippi (Universit\\u00e0 di Sassari) argues: \\u201cI do not see why the savings of my neighbour should be a problem for me. Rather, they are a potential source of financing my investment. I do not know a single reasonable model where current account surpluses are a problem.\\u201d \\nRobert Kollman points to research that the key shocks driving the German current account shocks are not central to the Eurozone\\u2019s ills (see Kollmann et al. 2015, 2016). Nezih Guner (Universitat Aut\\u00f2noma de Barcelona) agrees that German current account surpluses are structural: \\u201ccurrent account surpluses partly reflect positive supply shocks (such as labour market reforms that lowered wages and made German economy more competitive) and the current demographic structure that results in high savings rates.\\u201d Germany\\u2019s Fiscal Policy \\nWith exchange rate adjustment off the table within a currency union, the main policy recommendation to reduce Germany\\u2019s current account surplus has been a change in German fiscal policy. Martin Wolf points out that the current account surplus is driven primarily by an increase in the supply of savings of German households and thus reflects insufficient aggregate demand. 5 He warns that Germany isn\\u2019t carrying its weight in the global economy and has failed to contribute to global aggregate demand. \\nBy this view, the German government\\u2019s move to fiscal surplus is a direct drag on the global recovery. The argument is that with interest rates at zero and other governments in worse fiscal positions, the German government should do more to contribute to European and global demand. \\nThe IMF has called on Germany to \\u201cfocus on raising potential growth and reinforcing rebalancing, which will also support the fragile recovery in the euro area\\u201d, including the use of fiscal resources to \\u201cboost high quality public investment\\u201d. \\nThe European Commission concurs that \\u201cweak investment has contributed to the high and persistent current account surplus and poses risks for the future growth potential of the German economy\\u201d. The Commission joins the IMF in suggesting that \\u201cthere continues to be fiscal space for higher public investment, while complying with the rules of the stability and growth pact\\u201d. \\nIn contrast, Jens Weidmann suggests that an expansionary German fiscal policy will do little to spur demand in the Eurozone periphery as the import component of Germany public spending is merely 9%. And while Willem Buiter agrees that Germany\\u2019s current account surplus is excessive, he thinks that fiscal expansion may not be consistent with German inflation stability and that the European Central Bank should finance fiscal expansions elsewhere. 6 \\nThe second question in our survey asked the experts whether the current account imbalance is a reason for the German government to increase public spending. We were not asking whether public spending should increase for other reasons (say low interest rates), although current conditions may \\u2013 of course \\u2013 affect the answers given. \\nThe question was explicitly conditioned on the fact that Germany is part of the Eurozone and we asked the respondents to answer from the point of view of the Eurozone. That is, when countries\\u2019 fiscal deficits are high, the Eurozone regularly demands that action is taken to reduce public spending: so does it similarly make sense for the Eurozone to ask Germany to increase public spending given its large current account surplus? \\nQ2: Do you agree that the German government should increase public spending given its persistently large current account surplus and given that it is part of the Eurozone? \\n\\n\\nSixty-seven panel members answered this question with a large majority (67%) agreeing or strongly agreeing that the German government ought to increase public spending in response to the current account surpluses. \\nPanel members who think that the German current account poses risks to Eurozone stability largely supported policy action. The main policy recommendation is an increase in public investment. Stefan Gerlach (BSI Bank) proposes that \\u201cmore public spending on specific public infrastructure projects that pass a careful cost-benefit analysis and contributes to economic growth would be desirable.\\u201d \\nSweder van Wijnbergen (Universiteit van Amsterdam) notes that \\u201cGermany\\u2019s (public capital)/GDP ratio is HALF of the comparable ratio in the Netherlands\\u201d. In contrast, Nezih Guner thinks that public investment might be counterproductive: \\u201cPublic spending on investment incentives or infrastructure, for example, can further enhance the productivity advantage of German economy and can very well make the situation worse.\\u201d \\nAnother argument in favour of a German fiscal expansion relates to the asymmetry of fiscal rules in the Eurozone. Costas Milas (University of Liverpool) points out that \\u201cthe EU Treaty talks about \\u2018corrective\\u2019 fiscal measures when the deficit exceeds 3% of a country\\u2019s GDP. There is no similar mechanism in case of a (relatively) big fiscal surplus\\u201d. \\nRicardo Reis, on the other hand, states that \\u201cthe Treaties do not put the European institutions in charge of aggregate demand management. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for there to be a pronounced asymmetry between requiring the reduction of fiscal deficits, but having nothing to say about fiscal surpluses.\\u201d But he does suggest that discretionary policy is desirable at this point in time: \\u201cIt seems likely that both Germany and the rest of the Eurozone would benefit from some fiscal expansion in Germany\\u2026 Given the increase in the primary surplus since 2004, there also seems to be some room to do so.\\u201d \\nA number of panel members support policy action, but not an increase in public spending. Francesco Giavazzi (IGIER, Universit\\u00e0 Bocconi) and Nicholas Oulton (LSE) advocate tax cuts. In addition, J\\u00fcrgen von Hagen (Universit\\u00e4t Bonn) warns that fiscal action is desirable at the federal level, but not at the state level: \\u201cLander public finances are mostly unsustainable and an increase in spending is not called for.\\u201d Wendy Carlin (University College London) proposes increasing incentives for women to participate in the labour force. \\nPanel members who are opposed to German fiscal action largely point to the limited evidence that such action would reverse the current account surplus. Gernot M\\u00fcller (Eberhard-Karls-Universit\\u00e4t T\\u00fcbingen) points out that \\u201cevidence to date suggests that the link between fiscal policy and the current account is weak. In fact, not even the sign of how a fiscal expansion impacts the current account is clear (see Kim and Roubini\\u2019s 2008 paper on twin divergence).\\u201d \\nEvi Pappa (European University Institute) adds: \\u201cIn my own research, I also show that fiscal consolidation, as a means to induce an internal devaluation in a two country model works, but it affects very little economic activity in the periphery. A more effective way for correcting current account imbalances is transferring resources from Germany to the periphery\\u201d (see bandiera et al. 2016). \\nSee original post for references 0 0 0 0 0 0\", \"source_id\": 7946, \"article_id\": 322493}"
