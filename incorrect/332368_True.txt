"{\"title\": \"\\u201cRigged To Deny Trump\\u201d: Are They Stealing These States to Block Electoral Path to 270?\", \"source_id\": 17822, \"article_id\": 332368, \"content\": \"\\nWill the 2016 election be rigged?\\nThat depends on what the definition of \\u201cis\\u201d is \\u2013 and whether or not you count blatant media bias, operatives and instigators, shady quasi-voters, bizarre electronic voting \\u201cerrors\\u201d and a heavy-handed advantage in the electoral college and the shifting demographics of a socialist state that promises much to certain groups.\\nWith the GOP leadership turning its back on Trump, and the Democratic machine dedicated solely to providing for Her, it will be a difficult win for Trump, despite overwhelming enthusiasm at rallies across the entire country and lop-sided pro-Trump crowds that literally dwarf pro-Hillary gatherings of very few.\\nBut as most everyone knows by now, it isn\\u2019t the popular vote that counts \\u2013 but only the delegates awarded state-by-state to the electoral college\\u2026 and that is a game that Hillary\\u2019s operatives are very good at playing.\\nThere are several states that are being surprisingly maneuvered for her advantage\\u2026 and if successful, will block Trump from even coming close the presidency.\\nTexas Could Turn \\u201cBlue\\u201d For the First Time In 20 Years\\nThis is the big enchilada, so to speak. For the first time in many decades, Texas is in play for Hillary and the Democrats. Texas has been as solidly \\u201cred\\u201d as any state in the union, but 2016 could be different.\\nWith 38 electoral votes, the Lone Star State is the biggest prize on the map next to California, whose 55 electoral votes have gone to the Democrats since before history began. Since at least 2008, the Dems have been massaging their electioneering strategy to capitalize on shifting demographics \\u2013 with plenty of Hispanics in the next generation of voters. On paper, Hillary should be able to play well to Hispanics with all the controversy over Trump\\u2019s immigration stances and talk of a border wall. Rumors of illegal immigrants be encouraged to vote could be a crucial factor, with polls in Texas close to neck and neck\\u2026 it could go either way.\\n\\nOf course, there is every reason to think that Team Hillary is not taking any chances.\\nAs Michael Snyder and many others have reported , electronic voting machines have been mysteriously flipping votes for Hillary in several counties in Texas\\u2026 and that doesn\\u2019t bode well for a massive electoral prize that is within range for her campaign:\\nEarly voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning.\\nAt least one county is making an emergency switch to paper ballots after irregularities were found with the electronic machines during early voting.\\nMeanwhile, Infowars confronted the head of Texas\\u2019 elections about his decision to violate voter laws and abandon a manual count of a random sampling of 1-3% of votes (which should theoretically reflect the larger voting trend, unless something is fishy). Without that count, there is less accountability than ever:\\n\\nThis is major issue, and Texas isn\\u2019t the only state\\u2026 just the biggest.\\n2. Utah\\u2019s Independent Republican Could Actually Beat Trump \\nOK, so Utah only has a grand total of 6 electoral college votes\\u2026 and has never been a decisive swing state in a presidential election. But that is because the state has been so solidly \\u201cred.\\u201d However, this election is totally different.\\nA little known independent candidate named Evan McMullin has actually taken the lead in several recent polls in Utah, and is neck-and-neck with both Trump and Hillary in several other polls (at or around 30% apiece). Libertarian Gary Johnson is also playing (relatively) well at about 5% \\u2013 possibly enough to swing further momentum away form Trump.\\nBut Evan McMullin is the real surprise hit \\u2013 in a state that is suddenly considered an important battleground in the election.\\n\\nMcMullin is a Mormon, which gives him a significant boost. He is officially tied to Better for America, which is basically a #NeverTrump operation \\u2013 backed by neocons like William Kristol. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Evan McMullin has a pretty colorful and telling background : on top of being a former policy director for House Republicans, he\\u2019s also a former CIA operations officer; a member of the elite think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR); a former Goldman Sachs investment banker and a volunteer refugee resettlement officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Jordan.\\nWow! I wonder if there could be an agenda there. Hillary probably won\\u2019t win Utah, but Trump may not either \\u2013 and it could make a crucial difference if he is within striking distance of 270 electoral votes.\\n3. Florida Is a Must Win Swing State for Trump\\u2026 But Current Polls Show Possible Hillary Win \\nOh boy\\u2026 Florida all over again. With 29 electoral votes, it remains a major contender that is so often on the fence and swinging in the wind. It is considered essential for a Trump victory, and indeed for just about any successful Republican bid for the presidency.\\nSure, we all know the polls are rigged, and may be oversampling Dems to look better for Hillary on paper \\u2013 but nonetheless, that perception drives expectations.\\nIf She can create a convincing win there, it could change the course of the election once again. Florida has consistently been the closest outcome \\u2013 in 2008 and 2012 it went blue for Obama; in 2000 and 2004 it went red for Bush (and not without major controversy and some very shady recounting).\\nHer team is pushing heavily for early voting in Florida, and so far they claim an early voting advantage.\\nBut campaign surrogate Roger Stone is now reporting that Hillary has met secretly with Broward County officials in Florida, and there is speculation that problems with the voting machines may soon be happening all over again.\\n\\nPay very close to what happens there, because of course, Florida could be THE deciding state (again). Right now polls are within 2 points , currently in favor of Trump by a very narrow margin.\\n4. Colorado Has Known Voting Fraud Issues \\u2013 With Dead People on the Voter Rolls \\nWith 9 electoral votes, Colorado is currently swinging \\u201cblue\\u201d but could go either way. CBS4 and the Washington Times reported that an investigation was started by Colorado\\u2019s Secretary of State after multiple examples were found of deceased people registered and in the voter rolls:\\n\\u201cThis is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in Chicago, that kind of thing,\\u201d Mr. Maasssaid during a Thursday evening broadcast. \\u201cTonight, that changes. We did find voter fraud in Colorado that essentially waters down your vote.\\u201d \\n[\\u2026] \\n\\u201cThis is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in Chicago, that kind of thing,\\u201d Mr. Maasssaid during a Thursday evening broadcast. \\u201cTonight, that changes. We did find voter fraud in Colorado that essentially waters down your vote.\\u201d \\nIt\\u2019s not clear whether or not Colorado could make a difference in the outcome, but the results could prove suspect.\\n5. Hillary Is \\u201cLeading\\u201d In These Key Swing States \\nWhile Trump is expected to win the crucial state of Ohio, and also North Carolina, Hillary is projected to take key states including Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa, Virginia and Arizona.\\nAccording to the Washington Post :\\nif Clinton can hold Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Colorado, then she only needs one more out of many swing states \\u2014 New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, or Florida \\u2014 barring any surprise Trump win in a blue-leaning state like Wisconsin. That is currently looking very plausible. \\nWhile any of these could change in the actual outcome, it shows that Hillary has definitely maneuvered to win where it counts \\u2013 not with the people, but with the electoral college.\\nThe details are too numerous to follow here, and anything could happen.\\n6. You Know Voter Fraud Is Happening If the Media Claim It Isn\\u2019t \\nWhat should be very telling to everyone is how loudly the major media \\u2013 in concert \\u2013 are trying to debunk Trump\\u2019s claims of voter fraud and insist that all is well when it is quite clear that there are major issues.\\n\\nThis is one claim that the system is very afraid of, because quite frankly, they have a great deal to hide.\\nThere is more reason than ever for accountability, reporting on any irregularities and an insistence that the will of the people be respected \\u2013 because the system is desperate to hold onto control at any cost.\\nRead more: \\nElectronic Voting Machines Caught Switching Trump Votes To Hillary: \\u201cTrying to Steal Texas\\u201d \\nTrump Resists Pledge To \\u201cAbsolutely Accept\\u201d Election Results\\u2026 But Why Should Anyone Accept Fraud? \\nUnrest and Martial Law?
