"{\"content\": \"A retired four-star general called out Donald Trump as unfit to be president because he has failed to support US troops. \\nIn a conference call with reporters, Gen. John Allen (Ret.) said: Trump\\u2019s remarks are not only uninformed\\u2026but it also directly undercuts the courage and the commitment of our troops. And I took great exception to this. However he feels personally about this operation, he should be encouraging our efforts publicly, rather than disparaging them. \\n\\u2026. \\nWhile [Trump] appears not to understand basic military activities, it\\u2019s not clear to me that he\\u2019s interested in learning them, either. Because there are a number of experts, who I think\\u2026would advise him otherwise. But he seems to be confident in his knowledge. And that knowledge, I think, reveals a lot about what he doesn\\u2019t know. \\n\\u2026. \\nThis kind of rhetoric; this kind of disrespect for our military leadership; this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day \\u2013 it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be Commander-in-Chief. \\nMilitary experts, like Gen. Allen, feel compelled to criticize the Republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief. \\nThanks to Donald Trump, the Republican Party has become the party that doesn\\u2019t support the troops. \\nRepublicans have gone from \\u201creal America\\u201d to un-American in record time. \\nIf a presidential nominee doesn\\u2019t respect the men and women who risk their lives for the country, then he definitely won\\u2019t respect the needs of hard working Americans. \\nWith each word that comes out of his mouth, Trump continues to show America the real face of the Republican Party.\", \"article_id\": 323476, \"title\": \"Retired 4 Star General Blasts Trump For Not Supporting US Troops\", \"source_id\": 8910}"
