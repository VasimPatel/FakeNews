It is not yet known what caused the fight in Paris. \\nThere had already been scuffles on Monday as mainly Afghans and Eritreans tried to save their possessions during the raid, which started soon after 8am. \\nIt followed thousands of migrants arriving in the French capital following the razing of the Calais Jungle refugee camp last week. \\nWhile some 5,000 Jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around France, many others headed off independently, saying they still wanted to get to Britain. \\nUp to 3,000 set up tents on the pavements around the Stalingrad Metro station, which is close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub in the north of Paris. \\nShortly before Monday\\u2019s clearance French president Francois Hollande said: \\u2018We won\\u2019t tolerate the camps any longer.\\u2019 \\nReferring to the Paris clearance, Mr Hollande said: \\u2018We are going to carry out the same operation as in Calais.\\u2019 \\nCRS riot police around Stalingrad said there would be a \\u2018gradual operation\\u2019 which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone. \\nMeanwhile, the first ever official centre for refugees in Paris is due to be opened by the city\\u2019s Socialist council later this week. \\nThe \\u00a36m facility is also close to the Eurostar hub, and will have beds for 400 men. \\nBut local residents and business owners say it will attract people smugglers, and other criminals. \\nJean Brossard, who has been living in the area for 30 years, said: \\u2018None of us asked for an immigrant centre on our doorsteps. \\n\\u2018Everybody in the area is complaining. If these men want to go to England, then send them to England.\\u2019 \\nOthers have accused the Socialists of tokenism, saying they are simply opening the camps as a humanitarian gesture that will have no long term effect on Europe\\u2019s immigrant crisis. \\nThe official centre, which will include a football pitch, will only allow residents to stay for between five and 10 weeks, and is likely to shut down within two years. \\nAnother centre for women with children will also open in the Paris suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine later this year, or early next, but it too will only have a limited capacity of 350 temporary places. \\nMeanwhile, French authorities have started transporting migrant children out of Calais to processing centres around France, amid tensions around the closure of the vast Jungle camp. \\nThree buses carried a group of unaccompanied boys, mainly teenagers, out of the camp on Wednesday morning. \\nFrench authorities transferred more than 5,000 adult migrants out of Calais last week, but the fate of its 1,500 unaccompanied children remained unclear. \\nMigrants from the Middle East and Africa converged on the Jungle in hopes of crossing the English Channel to Britain. \\nPresident Francois Hollande said this week that the children would be transferred within days to \\u2018dedicated centres\\u2019 where British officials can explore whether they have the right to UK asylum. \\nMr Hollande said the others would be put in the care of French child welfare services.\", \"source_id\": 583, \"article_id\": 315204}"
