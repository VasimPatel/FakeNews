The students, members of the Oakland Unified School District\\u2019s Honour Band, knelt as they played the national anthem before a professional baseball game. \\nThe year 7 and 8 students spoke to Red Flag about their decision to \\u201ctake the knee.\\u201d Inspired by Kaepernick, high school members of the district\\u2019s school band first proposed the idea. Right away, the middle schoolers knew that it would be controversial. From their first day of school, US children are taught to show extreme reverence for the national flag during the anthem. This includes standing with hats off and hands on their hearts. Anything else is seen as highly disrespectful. \\nDespite this, some of the students felt so passionately about the need to take a stand against recent police killings that they still wanted to do it. \\nOne student, Mikayla, 14, delivered an impassioned speech to the others about the need to stand up against racism. \\u201cI wanted us to kneel because as a country we need to have a conversation about what is going on here,\\u201d she said, explaining why she felt so strongly. \\u201cWe have been turning our backs on murder and racism, and I was tired of not doing anything about it.\\u201d \\nBefore the game, band conductor Zack Pitt-Smith made it clear the decision to kneel would be each student\\u2019s choice. Even as they took the field, no-one was sure who was going to do it. \\nSerena, 14, remembers, \\u201cI was scared to kneel because I wasn\\u2019t sure if anyone else would join me. I was thinking, \\u2018Should I kneel? I feel very strongly about this \\u2014 I\\u2019m going to do it.\\u2019 But I was still shaking because I didn\\u2019t know what everyone else would do.\\u201d \\nNearly all of the 155 band members knelt as they played. Everyone had their own reasons. \\u201cI\\u2019m learning about human rights in history class, and the number\\u2026\", \"source_id\": 17276, \"article_id\": 331907}"
