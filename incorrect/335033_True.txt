(Gage Skidmore / Flickr / CC-BY-SA) \\n\\u201cWe have truly crossed a new Rubicon,\\u201d one campaign finance expert says in response to new data showing record levels of outside spending pouring into high-stakes Senate races this election cycle. \\nAccording to an analysis released Tuesday by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, outside groups\\u2014free from contribution limits and sometimes able to conceal their donors from the public\\u2014are outspending both political parties and candidates \\u201cin the battle for control of the U.S. Senate.\\u201d \\nIn fact, of the $557 million spent so far in 10 key Senate contests, the Brennan Center says such groups are responsible for $282 million, or 51 percent. Further, in each of the four most expensive contests\\u2014Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Pennsylvania\\u2014candidates account for 37 percent or less of total spending. \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\n\\u201cThis may be a new high for non-party outside spending, although direct comparisons to past cycles are hindered by a lack of available data,\\u201d the report states . \\nBrennan Center \\nThe analysis takes into account \\u201cshadow party groups\\u2014super PACs and nonprofits run by former top staff of party committees or party leaders and able to mimic party spending strategy\\u2014as nonparty outside groups,\\u201d the Brennan Center explains. \\u201cThis is because these groups, despite being controlled to some degree by the parties, take unlimited contributions and sometimes hide their donors. That the parties are increasingly outsourcing their finances to unregulated shadow parties severely weakens the campaign finance system\\u2019s protections against corruption and undue influence.\\u201d \\nAmong the report\\u2019s other notable findings: \\n\\u25cf GOP winning outside money battle: Nearly 60 percent of the money spent so far in top Senate races supports GOP candidates, a reversal from 2014. Dark money spending, from groups that conceal their donors, favors GOP candidates six to one. \\n\\u25cf Dark money spending is highly concentrated: Just three groups, One Nation, with ties to Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; the Koch network\\u2019s Americans for Prosperity; and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, account for 67 percent of all dark money spending. \\n\\u201cThe precipitous rise of outside groups is problematic for a few reasons,\\u201d said study author Ian Vandewalker, counsel in the Brennan Center\\u2019s democracy program. \\n\\u201cUnlike the parties and candidates, they are free to accept donations of unlimited size and can conceal their funders from the public,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cSo the bigger a role they play in an election, the more political power is concentrated in the hands of a few million-dollar funders and professional political operatives, with a consequent loss in power for the millions of Americans who can\\u2019t afford jumbo donations. While this problem was created in part by 2010\\u2019s Citizens United decision , the 2016 data shows we have truly crossed a new Rubicon.\\u201d \\nTo snatch back some of that power, the Brennan Center calls for the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse its damaging decision in Citizens United; for stronger rules against coordination between candidates and outside groups; for improved disclosure and transparency laws; and \\u201cmost fundamentally\\u201d for a public campaign financing system to \\u201cprovide an alternative to the incentives to chase bigger and bigger checks that currently drive political spending, allowing candidates to fund competitive campaigns without relying on the wealthiest donors.\\u201d \\nTwo such public financing systems are on statewide ballots this November.
