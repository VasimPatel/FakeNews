"{\"title\": \"A Republican Senator Just Told His Fans To Put A \\u201cBulls-Eye\\u201d On Hillary\\u2019s Face\", \"content\": \"Comments \\nNorth Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr was recorded not-so-subtly wishing that gun owners might shoot Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a despicable new tape that emerged on CNN. \\nBurr is the Republican Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a high title which seems inappropriate for a man of such small mind as to muse of the death of an American presidential candidate in a public place during a general election. CNN reports that : \\nThe North Carolina Republican, locked in a tight race for reelection [against Democrat Deborah Ross], quipped that as he walked into a gun shop \\u201cnothing made me feel better\\u201d than seeing a magazine about rifles \\u201cwith a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.\\u201d Sen. Richard Burr privately mused over the weekend that gun owners may want to put a \\u201cbullseye\\u201d on Hillary Clinton, according to audio obtained by CNN. \\n\\u201cI was a little bit shocked at that \\u2014 it didn\\u2019t have a bullseye on it,\\u201d he said Saturday to GOP volunteers, prompting laughter from the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. \\u201cBut on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there\\u2019s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.\\u201d \\nThe comments resemble similar ones made by Donald Trump in August when the GOP nominee said \\u201cSecond Amendment people\\u201d could take matters into their own hands if Clinton became president. \\nSenator Burr also mentioned how proud he was to have crippled the effectiveness of the Supreme Court by delaying President Obama\\u2019s appointment of Merrick Garland which itself has set a record for longest time after such an appointment without a hearing. \\nIn the same talk, Burr bragged that he\\u2019d support keeping the court in a state of permanent dysfunction by refusing any of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\\u2019s judicial appointments, including to the Supreme Court. \\nIt\\u2019s fast becoming apparent that Republicans merely used that piece of double-talk as the start of an existential attack on American-style democracy, which requires a reasonable opposition to cooperate and compromise in decisions for a functioning government for the betterment of the people. \\nDouble talk from Republican Congressmen of this type has become all too commonplace, but with Senator Burr\\u2019s lies to North Carolina voters, it\\u2019s so bold that he even gave opposite quotations to local reporters versus those inside the beltway and thought he could get away with it. \\nBurr both publicly distanced himself from Trump and at the very same time doubled down on supporting Trump after his tapes emerged revealing the Republican nominee\\u2019s serial predilection for sex assault. \\nNow that Richard Burr\\u2019s deplorable tape has emerged, the Republican Senator is facing calls to resign his position in the Senate altogether. \\nUnlike Trump, the North Carolina Republican has already issued an apology, but it remains to be seen whether that will have any saving grace for the vulnerable Republican, who is locked in a death heat with Democrat challenger Deborah Ross . \\nIt is absolutely unacceptable that an elected member of the United States Senate would even make jokes about the political assassination of one of our nation\\u2019s most dedicated public servants\", \"source_id\": 8527, \"article_id\": 323121}"
