"{\"content\": \"Turnbull to Propose Law That Bans Boat Asylum Seekers from Australia Permanently News, October 31, 2016 \\nFederal Labor will look closely at the government\\u2019s new tough stance on refugees but says it\\u2019s ridiculous that some banned from Australia won\\u2019t ever be allowed to visit for business, accusing Malcolm Turnbull of pandering to One Nation. \\nThe opposition has not entirely ruled out the government\\u2019s proposed lifetime ban on asylum seekers who arrive by boat, instead saying it will look at the legislation before coming up with a position. \\nUnder the plan, all adults sent to offshore immigration centres on Nauru and Papua New Guinea\\u2019s Manus Island would be prevented from ever entering Australia, even as tourists or on business, regardless of whether they\\u2019re found to be refugees or not. \\nThe coalition is ramping up its attack on Opposition Leader Bill Shorten for not publicly stating a position on the ban within 24 hours of its announcement. \\n\\u201cThis bloke is weak,\\u201d former immigration minister Scott Morrison told Sydney radio station 2GB. \\nMr Shorten says Labor will look closely at the legislation \\u201cwhen the government can be bothered releasing it\\u201d. \\n\\u201cIt seems ridiculous to me that a genuine refugee who settles in the US or Canada and becomes a US or Canadian citizen is banned from visiting Australia as a tourist, businessman or businesswoman 40 years down the track,\\u201d he said. \\nHe also took aim at the prime minister, saying the Mr Turnbull of old would never have proposed this to keep the right-wing extremists in his party happy. \\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s earning the praise of Pauline Hanson\\u2013I hope he\\u2019s proud of that.\\u201d \\nMeanwhile, One Nation is both applauding and claiming a win over the government\\u2019s tough stance. \\nIts Queensland senator Malcolm Roberts said the government was \\u201cdancing to our tune\\u2019, while leader Pauline Hanson put it more bluntly. \\n\\u201cRefugees are not welcome here,\\u201d she told the Seven Network. \\nConcerns have also been raised the ban may contravene article 31 of the international refugee convention, which states signatory nations shall not penalise refugees for illegal entry when they have come directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened. \\nAmnesty International says the outrageous and unnecessary law discriminates against people seeking safety based on their mode of arrival, a clear breach of Australia\\u2019s obligations. \\n\\u201c\\u201cThis is yet another layer of cruelty in Australia\\u2019s already deliberately abusive policy,\\u201d refugee campaigner Ming Yu Hah said. \\nBut Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull insists the plan does not contravene the convention. \\n\\u201cWe have taken legal advice and we are satisfied it is within power and consistent with our international obligations,\\u201d he told reporters in outback South Australia on Monday. \\nGreens leader Richard Di Natale told ABC radio he was hopeful that \\u201cif Labor shows a little bit of courage on this issue\\u201d, it could be struck down. \\nMr Turnbull said the government has spoken to just one of the 11 Senate crossbenchers about the proposal, which it will put to parliament next week. \\nIndependent senators Derryn Hinch and Nick Xenophon separately said they supported the government in general but wanted to see details. \\nMeanwhile, the debate comes as the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Francois Crepeau, is due to arrive on Tuesday to look at the government\\u2019s migration policies and laws. \\nEarlier \\nThe Federal Government wants to pass laws to make sure no asylum seekers who tried to come to Australia by boat, even those found to be refugees, can ever enter the country. \\nThe Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull today told media \\u201cthe door to Australia is closed to those who seek to come here by boat with a people smuggler\\u201d. \\n\\u201cThat absolutely unflinching, unequivocal message has to be loud and clear,\\u201d he told reporters in Sydney this morning. \\nThe government will ask parliament to ban everyone who was sent to Nauru or Papua New Guinea\\u2019s Manus Island for offshore immigration processing after July 19, 2013\\u2013the date Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd declared: \\u201cAs of today, asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia.\\u201d \\nThe ban would apply whether or not they were found to be refugees and extends to all types of visas, including tourist and business categories. Asylum seekers aged under 18 at the time they were sent to Nauru or Manus Island would be exempt. \\nThe minister would also have power to lift the bar if they believe it\\u2019s in the public interest for someone to be allowed in to Australia. \\nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton described the plan as one of the government\\u2019s strongest moves, building on the success of its border protection policies over the past three years. \\nIt sent a clear message that Australia was not an option. \\n\\u201cThere are still people, advocates in Australia and elsewhere, who are messaging to people on Nauru and Manus, that at some stage you\\u2019ll come to Australia,\\u201d Mr Dutton said. \\n\\u201cThose people are living in false hope and it cannot continue.\\u201d The legislation would reflect the coalition\\u2019s long-standing policy and what it understood to be Labor\\u2019s position, Mr Turnbull said. \\nHe expects the opposition will give \\u201cunequivocal support\\u201d to the move. \\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop earlier this morning said the government would enshrine in law what had been a longstanding policy. \\n\\u201cThis is a tough message we are sending to the people smuggling syndicates and those who pay people smugglers to try and enter Australia,\\u201d she told ABC TV. \\n\\u201cWe are sending a strong message to those currently in Manus and Nauru, if they are found to be owed protection, they will not be resettled in Australia. If they\\u2019re not found to be owed protection, they should return home.\\u201d \\nThis would even apply to accepted refugees later attempting to visit via tourist visa, she said. \\n\\u201cI will never forget 1200 people that we know of drowned at sea coming to Australia under these people smuggling networks,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe cannot have situations where people are drowning at sea and that is why we are working through the case load, the cohort of people who are on Manus and Nauru, to find third country resettlements for them and if they want to stay in PNG and in Nauru, they can be resettled there.\\u201d \\nMr Turnbull expects Labor and its leader Bill Shorten will support the laws, saying they are \\u201centirely consistent with his party\\u2019s stated public position\\u201d. \\nMr Dutton added Australia has \\u2018discussions ongoing with a number of countries\\u2019 on the issue of resettling the asylum seekers already at Naru and Manus. \\nDeputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek said it was too soon to determine if Labor would support the bill. \\n\\u201cWhat I\\u2019d say is it\\u2019s a distraction from Peter Dutton\\u2019s hopeless mismanagement of his portfolio,\\u201d she told reporters on the Gold Coast. \\n\\u201cIt is extraordinary that, three years on, the government has not found third countries to resettle those people who are in limbo on Manus Island and Nauru.\\u201d She said Mr Dutton needed to find a permanent resettlement option for these people left in limbo.\", \"source_id\": 583, \"article_id\": 315185, \"title\": \"Turnbull to Propose Law That Bans Boat Asylum Seekers from Australia Permanently\"}"
