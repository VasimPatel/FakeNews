But for Jim Chilton, it\\u2019s the only way he\\u2019ll get a good night\\u2019s sleep. \\nThe 77-year-old, a fifth-generation rancher on the Arizona border with Mexico, says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglers\\u2013rather than just cattle\\u2013on his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles. \\n\\u201cI really admire Trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know what\\u2019s wrong with the current border system,\\u201d he said, as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his 75-square-mile ranch that stretches to the Mexican border. \\n\\u201cWe need a wall. I\\u2019ve been saying that for 10 years . . . and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in,\\u201d he added. \\u201cIt would make my life so much better and I\\u2019d feel more secure.\\u201d \\n{snip} \\nChilton, who admits that Trump was not his first choice among the Republican candidates for the White House, says building a barrier to secure the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) US-Mexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security. \\n{snip} \\n\\u201cI live in a no-man\\u2019s land. I live in a land that is occupied by the Sinaloa drug cartel,\\u201d he sighed, pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers. \\n\\u201cI have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before . . . and even in my front yard,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI wave at them and they often yell \\u2018hola\\u2019 and wave back.\\u201d \\nChilton\\u2013who keeps a gun holstered on his hip, a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedside\\u2013added that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like Islamic State (IS) may be using them to slip operatives into the United States. \\n{snip} \\nBut beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism, Chilton insists that Trump\\u2019s wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons. \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch. It\\u2019s outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and it\\u2019s outrageous for my cowboys,\\u201d he said, referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the US through the brutal desert. \\n\\u201cThis is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue.\\u201d \\n{snip} \\nAccording to the US Border Patrol, nearly 2,600 bodies have been recovered since 1998 from the desert in the Tucson, Arizona sector which covers 262 miles of the border. \\n{snip}\"}"
