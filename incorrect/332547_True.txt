Defaults are on the rise and the issue has grown to become a nasty wealth transfer mechanism, as well as sad example of the failure of finance in general. \\nThis week, President Obama announced a new initiative framed as a way of addressing the issue. Sadly, it is far from the mark, and just one more indication that monetary masters are the real puppeteers. \\nMany have pointed out that the student loan debt bubble could be the next subprime crisis. \\nPerhaps so, but it is potentially much worse, acting as an anvil when considered in the context of other consumer debt like car loans and credit cards. \\nThe student debt debacle has the potential of corrupting not only education, but a generation as well. \\nIt risks becoming the blight on a generation of would-be productive and innovative work force. \\nFurthermore, the workforce declines, and falls behind, as more students return home to live with parents. And the extra burden on multi-generational households adds yet another deflationary force to the natural trend. \\nFrom the perspective of bankers, policy makers, and the propaganda machine, college loan programs have been a tremendous success, providing access for students who would otherwise not be able to afford the privilege. \\nIt is about threading a narrow political path. \\nDefaults are on the rise and the notional value of student loans went north of $1 trillion. \\nServicers must be getting nervous; the lobbyists are circling the wagons. \\nThere is no clear indication of who will pay for it \\u2013 or how. \\nDefaults on the rise; one in seven currently default. \\nThe news of doing something comes around to yet another intervention with all the familiar signs that it is meant to save the financiers and has very little to do with helping students. \\nThe problem is that this is too little too late. \\nStudent loan debt is a trillion dollar reality in the context of a major, ongoing depression. \\nWe are a Nanny state \\u2013 with almost 50 million on food stamps and more on some sort of assistance. Labor force participation is at 40 year lows. \\nThere is already a major dis-incentive to work. If you take a horrible minimum wage job, you lose valuable benefits, entitlements. \\nWhich, incidentally, also explains why while it took the U.S. economy 6 years to recover all the job losses since Lehman. This took place at the expense of 13 million Americans leaving the labor force for good even as the U.S. population rose by 15 million. \\nIt also means that using a historical average participation rate, U.S. unemployment is over 11%, while underemployment is currently well in the 20% range \\u2013 a far more realistic assessment of where the U.S. economy really is. \\nPeople on assistance programs are literally paid to stay home \\u2013 think of the cultural implications. \\nIt\\u2019s almost a conspiracy. You have a massive class of under the table people with no voice. Give them bread and circuses. \\nThe student loan debacle is another story. \\nFor the parents, the typical situation is framed by skyrocketing tuition; and little help from scholarships become fractions in the face of rising tuition. \\nThe income cut-off for need-based financial aid is low. \\nParents are expected to contribute 25% of pre-tax income to the cost of tuition. \\nIf you earn $80K a year and your child\\u2019s college tuition is $20K, you get nothing in terms of need-based financial aid. And that 25% doesn\\u2019t count room & board, books, etc. \\nSo, it\\u2019s basically impossible for middle-class families to send their kids to college without taking out student loans. In fact, the entire higher-education system is built to force people into debt if they want to send their kids to college. \\nAnd it has a sinister underlying theme\\u2026 \\nIt\\u2019s always about the \\u201cirresponsible student\\u201d or the \\u201chairdresser subprime loan borrower\\u201d who \\u201cshould have known better\\u201d. \\nThey should have known that housing prices eventually fall, even though \\u201ceveryone\\u201d in the mainstream, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve said they would not. They should have read carefully the fine print instead of trusting the fancy loan officer. \\nAnd everyone knows that without a college education you will not succeed, so \\u201cborrow whatever it takes\\u201d. You\\u2019ll pay it back. \\nTwo decades of further tweaks to the bankruptcy code ensued until 2005, when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This Act made it so that no student loan \\u2014 federal or private \\u2014 could be discharged in bankruptcy unless the borrower can prove repaying the loan would cause \\u201cundue hardship,\\u201d a condition that is incredibly difficult to demonstrate unless the person has a severe disability. It essentially lumps student loan debt in with child support and criminal fines \\u2014 other types of debt that can\\u2019t be discharged. \\nBut our system is perfectly fine going after the invisible \\u2013 those without a political voice \\u2013 whether the poor or elderly who get crushed by inflation, or the 18 year olds who get out with $100K in debt and an art appreciation degree. \\nBut the price of education should tell an even deeper story\\u2026. \\nQuality of Education Suffers \\nThe compounding irony is that not only does the price of education go up, but the quality goes down. Institutions become entrenched. There is little incentive evolve, tenure runs rampant. And the curriculum declines. \\nHigher education becomes both a commodity and a spectacle. Not a vehicle for progress or a reflection of the needs of the culture or the economy. \\nThat may not be hyperinflation\\u2026but it\\u2019s very sad. College education quality has not risen proportionately with price. \\nStudent loan debt is out of control by any and all measures. It\\u2019s a debacle that benefits no one besides the banker and the servicers. The schools lose by making themselves unviable in the long run. \\nThe students come away with non-dischargeable student loans and enter a world without, for the most part, having any marketable skills. \\nSadly, the student loans are just one more politically untouchable issue providing yet another source of highly flammable fuel that will result in more gasoline when the Fed is called in.\", \"source_id\": 17922, \"article_id\": 332547}"
