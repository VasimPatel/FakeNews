Interim State Forester Gary Cole said in a statement Monday that extremely dry conditions have created favorable environments for wildfires during the past several weeks. \\\"The drought creates a dangerous scenario where wildfire can quickly spread out of control, destroying forestland and threatening homes,\\\" Cole said. Gov. Robert Bentley on Oct. 12 signed a drought emergency declaration, putting 46 counties under the no burn order. Cole says that order will remain in effect until weather conditions have significantly improved. Citing a 10-day forecast of low potential for rainfall, Cole says there is \\\"no relief in sight.\\\" Violators of the burn ban could face a fine of up to $500 and up to six months in jail if convicted.
