But who was it? And when would the authorities ever catch these jerks? \\nAnd could somebody please make those awful calls stop? \\nAt last, we\\u2019re hearing about a major break in the case. After a three-year joint investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice obtained an indictment involving 56 alleged fraudsters based in the United States and also five call centers in India, all accused of tricking people into paying fake tax bills either by wire or placing money on prepaid cards. \\nThe United States will be seeking the extradition of those based in India and warned others engaged in similar schemes. \\nThe indictment accuses the U.S. arm of the network of grabbing the cash off the prepaid cards and then laundering the money. It also accuses fast-talkers at the call centers of tricking victims into thinking they were talking to the IRS \\u2014 or authorities from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\", \"article_id\": 322178}"
