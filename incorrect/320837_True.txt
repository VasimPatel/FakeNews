"{\"title\": \"Trump\\u2019s Presidential Cabinet Picks Leak And They Are TERRIFYING\", \"content\": \"  \\nRumors are circulating of who Donald Trump is considering to serve as his cabinet members if he wins on Tuesday, and the names on his list will chill you to the bone. \\nAccording to several sources close to Trump, high ranking Republicans who have stood by the GOP nominee\\u2019s side throughout the campaign have made the short list. Which means, of course, that he has chosen the worst of the worst. \\nNBC reports : \\n\\u201cAmong the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary.\\u201d \\nReince Priebus, the current RNC chairman, is also being considered as a possibility to serve as Trump\\u2019s chief of staff. He earned the favor of the bigoted billionaire by staunchly defending him time and time again when other Republicans were quick to jump ship. \\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re thinking, \\u2018We need to find that balance between someone who knows how Washington works and someone who shakes things up,'\\u201d the senior campaign adviser said. \\nNBC points out that appointing Priebus as chief of staff would be \\u201can olive branch to the establishment,\\u201d but it isn\\u2019t clear at the moment if the RNC chair would even consider taking the position. \\nOne veteran of the George W. Bush White House said that Trump\\u2019s transition team had convinced him that they were looking for people to fill these positions that had \\u201cexperience\\u201d in Washington. \\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re reaching out to people with experience, they\\u2019re listening to them, they\\u2019re taking their counsel,\\u201d the former official said. \\u201cI was very impressed.\\u201d \\nThe NBC report did say that Trump really isn\\u2019t putting the cart before the horse, so to speak. The sources they spoke to said the Trump campaign is \\u201cfocused on winning first and foremost as well and no decisions have been made or positions finalized.\\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks said that \\u201cnone of this is accurate\\u201d and added that Trump \\u201cis entirely focused on the campaign and the American people.\\u201d \\nFeatured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images Share this Article!\", \"source_id\": 6220, \"article_id\": 320837}"
