Speculation swirled around the identity of that party until an Israeli newspaper reported it was Cellebrite. \\nIt turns out the company was not the third party that helped the FBI. A Cellebrite representative said as much during a panel discussion at a high-tech crimes conference in Minnesota this past April, according to a conference attendee who spoke with The Intercept. And sources who spoke with the Washington Post earlier this year also ruled out Cellebrite\\u2019s involvement, though Yossi Carmil, one of Cellebrite\\u2019s CEOs, declined to comment on the matter when asked by The Intercept. \\nBut the attention around the false report obscured a bigger, more interesting truth: Cellebrite\\u2019s researchers have become, over the last decade, the FBI\\u2019s go-to hackers for mobile forensics. Many other federal agencies also rely on the company\\u2019s expertise to get into mobile devices. Cellebrite has contracts with the FBI going back to 2009, according to federal procurement records, but also with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and DHS\\u2019s Customs and Border Protection. U.S. state and local law enforcement agencies use Cellebrite\\u2019s researchers and tools as well, as does the U.S. military, to extract data from phones seized from suspected terrorists and others in battle zones. \\nThe company is poised to seize a prominent and somewhat ominous place in the public imagination; just as Apple has come to be seen as a warrior for digital protection and privacy against overreaching government surveillance, Cellebrite is emerging as its law-and-order counterpart, endeavoring to build tools to break through the barriers Apple and other phone makers erect to protect data. \\n\\u201cVendors \\u2026 are implementing more and more security features into their product, and that\\u2019s definitely challenging for us,\\u201d says Shahar Tal, director of research at Cellebrite. \\u201cBut we\\u2019ve solved these challenges before [and] we continue to solve these challenges today.\\u201d \\nIn July, months after the unknown third party provided the FBI with a method for getting into the San Bernardino phone \\u2014 an iPhone 5C running iOS 9 \\u2014 Cellebrite announced that it had developed its own technique for bypassing the phone\\u2019s password/encryption lock. And the company is confident that it will be able to deal successfully with future security changes Apple may make to its phones in the wake of the San Bernardino case.\", \"source_id\": 1395, \"article_id\": 316005}"
