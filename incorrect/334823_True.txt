"{\"title\": \"Donald or Hillary: A Decision Between Life and Death\", \"content\": \"Donald or Hillary: A Decision Between Life and Death November 08, 2016 Donald or Hillary: A Decision Between Life and Death \\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump have taken starkly different views on life and family issues. While both candidates may be \\\"flawed\\\" from the perspective of moral values, a breakdown of their positions shows clearly that America will go down one of two very different roads today. \\nBelow are some of the candidates' more notable stances and quotes on moral issues, as well as the positions each party platform takes. \\nABORTION \\nHillary Clinton: supports taxpayer-funded abortion through all nine months of pregnancy. has promised to repeal the Hyde Amendment, the law prohibiting the use of tax dollars for Medicaid abortions. said she will stand with and fund Planned Parenthood, America's largest abortion provider. defended partial-birth and late-term abortion in her final debate with Donald Trump. Here are some of her most notable abortion quotes: \\\"The unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights.\\\" \\\"Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources, and political will. Deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed.\\\" \\\"I believe that forcing a woman to carry a child who she knows will die is an assault...\\\" \\\"[Family] planning is an important part of women's health, and reproductive health includes access to abortion.\\\" \\\"We've gotta continue to stand up for a woman's right to make these decisions--and to defend Planned Parenthood.\\\" \\\"I support Roe v. Wade.\\\" \\\"Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account and when I voted as a senator [against banning partial-birth abortion], I did not think that that was [the] case.\\\" \\\"The kinds of [abortion] cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get: that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term, or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions for women. So, you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and health of the mother taken into account...this is one of the worst possible choices any woman and her family has to make.\\\" \\\"I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in China or force women to bear children like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice, and I will stand up for that right.\\\" \\\"Now, extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don\\u2019t want to live in the modern world, but it\\u2019s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States.\\\" \\\"I\\u2019ve been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood for a long time, and, as president, I will always have your back.\\\" \\\"I'm grateful to the entire Planned Parenthood family. You made this campaign your own...It belongs to the staff, the donors, and to the [abortion] providers...It is worth saying again: defending women\\u2019s health means defending access to abortion \\u2013 not just in theory, but in reality...We need to stand up for access to affordable contraception without interference from politicians or employers. And let's invest in long-acting contraceptives, so every woman can choose the method that is best for her.\\u201d \\nDonald Trump: promised to sign the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would end painful, gruesome late-term abortions. pledged to defund Planned Parenthood. says he will appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices. Here are some of Trump's more notable quotes on abortion: \\u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that\\u2019s okay, and Hillary can say that that\\u2019s okay, but it\\u2019s not okay with me because based on what she\\u2019s saying and based on where she's going and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day, and that\\u2019s not acceptable...Honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth, nobody has that.\\\" \\\"I am, and will remain, pro-life.\\\" \\\"Let me be clear \\u2014 I am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me...Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago, over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of this country. They are missing, and they are missed. The Supreme Court in 1973 based its decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found...Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best...A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.\\\" \\nRELIGIOUS FREEEDOM \\nHillary Clinton: has said \\\"religious beliefs\\\" against abortion \\\"have to be changed.\\\" supports the Obama administration's HHS contraception and abortion mandate, which forces religious institutions and churches to fund abortions. Here are some of her more notable quotes on religious freedom: \\\"Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources, and political will. Deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed.\\\" \\u201c[The Hobby Lobby case is] the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means the corporation\\u2019s \\u2026 [\\u2018closely held\\u2019] employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees, and, of course, denying women the right to contraceptives as part of a health care plan is exactly that. I find it deeply disturbing that we are going in that direction. It\\u2019s very troubling that a sales clerk at Hobby Lobby who need[s] contraception, which is pretty expensive, is not going to get that service through her employer\\u2019s health care plan because her employer doesn\\u2019t think she should be using contraception.\\\" \\\"Every woman, no matter where she works, deserves birth control coverage. This shouldn't be a question.\\\" \\nDonald Trump: has promised to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which threatens churches with the loss of their tax statuses if they endorse political candidates. says he will fight on behalf of Christians in the Middle East who are facing genocide. Here are some of his more notable quotes on religious freedom: \\\"I have a message for Catholics: I will be there for you. I will stand with you. I will fight for you. \\\"As First Lady, US Senator, Secretary of State, and two-time presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton has been hostile to the core issues and policies of greatest concern to Catholics: life, religious liberty, Supreme Court nominations, affordable and quality healthcare, educational choice and home schooling. \\\"For instance, Hillary Clinton supports forcing The Little Sisters of the Poor who have taken care of the elderly poor since 1839, to pay for contraceptives in their healthcare plan (even though they have never wanted them, never used them and never will), and having the government fine them heavily if they continue to refuse to abide by this onerous mandate. \\\"This is a hostility to religious liberty you will never see in a Trump administration.\\\" \\\"I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions. I will make absolutely certain religious orders like The Little Sisters of Poor are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs. I will protect and work to expand educational choice, the rights of homeschooling families, and end Common Core. I will repeal and replace Obamacare so you can have better and more affordable healthcare. I will keep our country and communities safe while respecting the dignity of each human being. I will help Catholic families and workers, and all families and workers, by bringing jobs back to our country where they belong. And I will appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not legislate from the bench, like Justice Clarence Thomas and the late and beloved great Catholic thinker and jurist, Justice Antonin Scalia.\\\" \\n\\nSAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND THE LGBT MOVEMENT \\nHillary Clinton: touts herself as a champion of the \\\"LGBT community.\\\" wants to criminalize therapy helping minors resolve unwanted same-sex attraction. will \\\"protect transgender rights.\\\" says she will \\\"fight for full federal equality for LGBT Americans\\\" by making gender identity and sexual orientation federally protected classes. Here are a few of her many pro-LGBT statements: \\\"Gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\\\" \\\"Thanks to the bravery of LGBT Americans like Jim Obergefell and Edie Windsor, and the determination and tireless organizing of the LGBT community and their allies, marriage equality became the law of the land in all 50 states...we've also seen how much work is still unfinished....Discriminatory laws in states like North Carolina highlight the need for full federal equality under the law for LGBT Americans.\\\" \\\"Along with millions of Americans, I am celebrating today's landmark victory for marriage equality, and the generations of advocates and activists who fought to make it possible. From Stonewall to the Supreme Court, the courage and determination of the LGBT community has changed hearts and changed laws. \\\"This ruling is an affirmation of the commitment of couples across the country who love one another. It reflects the will of the vast and growing multitude of Americans who believe that LGBT couples deserve to be recognized under the law and treated equally in the eyes of society. And it represents our country at its best: inclusive, open, and striving towards true equality. \\\"But we know that the struggle for LGBT rights doesn't end with today's triumph. As love and joy flood our streets today, it is hard to imagine how anyone could deny the full protection of our laws to any of our fellow Americans\\u2014but there are those who would. So while we celebrate the progress won today, we must stand firm in our conviction to keep moving forward. For too many LGBT Americans who are subjected to discriminatory laws, true equality is still just out of reach. While we celebrate today, our work won't be finished until every American can not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn and raise a family free from discrimination and prejudice. We cannot settle for anything less.\\\" \\\"I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\\\" \\nDonald Trump: says marriage is ultimately an issue that should be decided by the states. says he supports natural marriage. says that he will \\\"fight\\\" for the LGBT community, especially as he fights ISIS and radical Islam. Here are some of Trump's more notable quotes on same-sex \\\"marriage\\\" and the \\\"LGBT community\\\": \\u201cThank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.\\u201d \\\"As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.\\\" \\\"We\\u2019re going to look at judges. They\\u2019ve got to be great judges. They\\u2019ve got to be conservative judges. We\\u2019re going to see how they stand depending on what their views are. But that would be my preference [that they oppose same-sex 'marriage]. I would prefer that they stand against, but we\\u2019ll see what happens. It depends on the judge.\\\" \\u201cI would strongly consider that, yes,\\\" in response to a question about whether he would appoint justices to overrule the Supreme Court's same-sex \\\"marriage\\\" decision. \\u201c[Marriage] should be a states rights issue. I can see changes coming down the line, frankly.\\u201d \\n\\nTHE CANDIDATE'S CAMPAIGN WEBSITES \\nFrom the official Hillary Clinton campaign site: \\\"Hillary will work with Congress to pass the Equality Act, continue President Obama\\u2019s LGBT equality executive actions, and support efforts underway in the courts to protect people from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in every aspect of public life...Hillary will end so-called 'conversion therapy' for minors, combat youth homelessness by ensuring adequate funding for safe and welcoming shelters, and take on bullying and harassment in schools. She\\u2019ll end discriminatory treatment of LGBT families in adoptions, and protect LGBT elders against discrimination....Hillary applauds the Pentagon\\u2019s decision to allow transgender personnel to serve openly, and as Commander-in-Chief, she will upgrade service records of LGBT veterans dismissed due to their sexual orientation...Hillary will work to protect transgender individuals from violence, make it easier for transgender Americans to change their gender marker on identification documents, and invest in law enforcement training focused on fair and impartial policing, including in interactions with LGBT people.\\\" \\\"Hillary will promote LGBT human rights and ensure America\\u2019s foreign policy is inclusive of LGBT people, including increasing our investment in the Global Equality Fund to advance human rights.\\\" \\\"In the U.S. Senate, Hillary championed legislation to address hate crimes, fought for federal non-discrimination legislation to protect LGBT Americans in the workplace, and advocated for an end to restrictions that blocked LGBT Americans from adopting children. \\\"As secretary of state, Hillary advanced LGBT rights abroad and enforced stronger anti-discrimination regulations within the State Department, declaring on the global stage that 'gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.' She led the effort to pass the first-ever U.N. Resolution on LGBT Human Rights, launched the Global Equality Fund, ended State Department regulations that denied same-sex couples and their families equal rights, helped implement LGBT-friendly workplace policies, and updated the State Department\\u2019s policy so that transgender individuals\\u2019 passports reflect their true gender.\\\" \\nDonald Trump's official campaign website does not mention his stances on abortion or marriage. \\n\\nTHE PARTY PLATFORMS \\nRepublican platform: Against abortion, against Planned Parenthood, pro-religious liberty, pro-marriage, pro-homeschooling, pro-sexual risk avoidance education \\u201cThe Constitution\\u2019s guarantee that no one can 'be deprived of life, liberty or property' deliberately echoes the Declaration of Independence\\u2019s proclamation that 'all' are 'endowed by their Creator' with the inalienable right to life. Accordingly, we assert the sanctity of human life and afrm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s protections apply to children before birth.\\u201d \\u201cWe oppose the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion or to fund organizations, like Planned Parenthood, so long as they provide or refer for elective abortions or sell fetal body parts rather than provide healthcare.\\u201d \\u201cWe support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.\\\" \\u201cWe value the right of America\\u2019s religious leaders to preach, and Americans to speak freely, according to their faith. Republicans believe the federal government, specically the IRS, is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring speech based on religious convictions or beliefs, and therefore we urge the repeal of the Johnson Amendment.\\u201d \\u201cWe support options for learning, including home-schooling, career and technical education, private or parochial schools, magnet schools, charter schools, online learning, and early-college high schools. We especially support the innovative nancing mechanisms that make options available to all children: education savings accounts (ESAs), vouchers, and tuition tax credits.\\u201d \\u201cWe renew our call for replacing 'family planning' programs for teens with sexual risk avoidance education that sets abstinence until marriage as the responsible and respected standard of behavior.\\u201d \\u201cWe condemn the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling in United States v. Windsor, which wrongly removed the ability of Congress to dene marriage policy in federal law. We also condemn the Supreme Court\\u2019s lawless ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges\\u2026.In Obergefell, ve unelected lawyers robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to dene marriage as the union of one man and one woman.\\u201d \\nDemocrat platform: Taxpayer funded abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, pro-Planned Parenthood, pro-LGBT, pro-contraception sex ed \\u201cDemocrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. We believe unequivocally that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion\\u2014regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured. We believe that reproductive health is core to women\\u2019s, men\\u2019s, and young people\\u2019s health and wellbeing\\u2026. We will continue to oppose\\u2014and seek to overturn\\u2014federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman\\u2019s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.\\u201d \\u201cWe will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people.\\u201d \\u201cWe will appoint judges who defend the constitutional principles of liberty and equality for all, protect a woman\\u2019s right to safe and legal abortion, curb billionaires\\u2019 inuence over elections because they understand that Citizens United has fundamentally damaged our democracy, and see the Constitution as a blueprint for progress.\\u201d \\u201cDemocrats know that our nation, our communities, and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith in many forms and the countless acts of justice, mercy, and tolerance it inspires. We believe in lifting up and valuing the good work of people of faith and religious organizations and nding ways to support that work where possible.\\\" \\u201cDemocrats are also committed to providing parents with high-quality public school options and expanding these options for low-income youth. We support great neighborhood public schools and high-quality public charter schools, and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators. Democrats oppose for-prot charter schools focused on making a prot off of public resources.\\u201d \\u201cWe recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care, evidence-based sex education, and a full range of family planning services help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies.\\\" \\u201cDemocrats applaud last year\\u2019s decision by the Supreme Court that recognized LGBT people\\u2014like every other American\\u2014have the right to marry the person they love. But there is still much work to be done.\\\" \\nThis article originallly appeared on LifeSiteNews.com , with commentary provided by TRUNEWS Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?
