Manny Pacquiao is more than a world-class athlete or a Filipino politician. He\\u2019s a compassionate activist who paid for 1,000 homes to be built to help out underprivileged families in his hometown. \\nVia Anonews \\n\\nEarlier this year, Pacquiao proclaimed his good deed on Facebook: \\u201cI\\u2019m so happy giving this houses free to my constituents in Sarangani Province from my own pocket more than thousand families are the beneficiaries.\\u201d\\nThe Star reports that the \\u2018born-again Christian\\u2019 was inspired to help poor families after duking it out with Floyd Mayweather. Though he lost the boxing match, he still earned millions of dollars in the \\u2018fight of the century\\u2019 and felt it was his duty to give back.\\nHe wrote: \\n\\u201cAs faithful stewards of God\\u2019s grace in its various forms, each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others. I\\u2019m still building more because I always believe what the bible says offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.\\u201d\\nThe act of compassion could be nothing more than a calculated political move, but nonetheless, 1,000 families have secure living spaces thanks to the Senator\\u2019s generosity. That, we believe, is worth celebrating.\\n\", \"source_id\": 19982, \"article_id\": 334536}"
