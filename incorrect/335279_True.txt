There is recent evidence showing women treated differently for similar symptoms. The Yentl Syndrome \\nSometimes movies can have an impact in ways nobody who wrote or worked on the movie could possibly imagine. \\nIn the 1983 film \\u201cYentl\\u201d, Barbara Streisand\\u2019s character plays the role of a male in order to receive the education she wants. Dr. Bernadine Healy used the phrase \\u201cYentl Syndrome\\u201d in an academic paper eight years after the film was released. She used it to describe how many women died because they were misdiagnosed because their symptoms were different than men. \\nToday the term Yentl Syndrome is widely used as a description of how women are more likely to be treated less aggressively than men. This is primarily because medical research has focused on the symptoms of male heart attacks, and many women have different symptoms. \\nThe term Yentl Syndrome has also been used in a wider context of how because women experience pain differently than men, many healthcare providers do not take the pain of a woman as seriously as they do a man. Prove You Are As Sick as a Male Patient \\nIn initial encounters with the health-care system, women are more likely to be treated less aggressively than men until they \\u201cprove that they are as sick as male patients\\u201d, according to a study entitled \\u201cThe Girl Who Cried Pain,\\u201d. A contributing factor is that most emergency rooms in the United States do not have an attending OB-GYN. \\nWomen were less likely to receive aggressive treatment when diagnosed, and were more likely to have their pain characterized as \\u201cemotional\\u201d or \\u201cpsychogenic\\u201d and therefore \\u201cnot real\\u201d according to the study. \\nThese misplaced characterizations can lead to treatment for mental health issues that might not even exist in the patient. Then the situation is further complicated because antidepressants are absorbed differently in women and may have different levels of effectiveness.
