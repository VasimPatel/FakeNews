It also reported that another 34 percent of Bavarians said they had \\u201cslight\\u201d dislike for followers of Islam.

The second most negatively perceived group was actually the long-time unemployed, as more than 80 percent of Bavarians had at least \\u201cslightly\\u201d negative attitude towards them, although only 4 percent had a \\u201cstrong\\u201d animosity towards this section of society.

Ten percent of Bavarians said they had a \\u201cstrong\\u201d negative attitude towards Roma \\u2013 the second highest figure among all the groups in focus. \\nIn the case of refugees, about a third of Bavarians held either \\u201cmoderate\\u201d or \\u201cstrong\\u201d antipathy towards them. \\nAt the same time, the study showed that people of Bavaria have no negative attitude towards foreigners living in Germany in general as 56 percent of respondents said they had no bad feelings towards foreigners and only 10 percent of those questioned demonstrated \\u201cmoderate\\u201d or \\u201chigh\\u201d level of animosity towards them. \\nBavarians were also almost equally tolerant towards gay people as 54 percent of respondents showed no antipathy towards them. They were also even less prone to what the study called \\u201cclassic racism\\u201d that consists in viewing white people more positively than the people of other races. About three quarters of respondents showed no signs of racism at all, while only about 10 percent of them had \\u201cmoderate\\u201d or \\u201cstrong\\u201d racist views. \\nThe study also showed that men are more prone to various forms of negative attitude towards the distinct groups in focus than women as well as that people having higher level of education tend to be more tolerant and less prejudged towards all these groups.

He added that \\u201cthose, who ostracize outsiders, go against Jesus\\u201d Christ. \\nAt the same time, the issue is not limited to Bavaria, as sentiments similar to those presented in the study are common across the whole of Germany, Ralf Melzer, who works for the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, told dpa.

The event drew thousands of supporters who demonstrated against the chancellor\\u2019s refugee policy.\", \"source_id\": 17436, \"article_id\": 331985}"
