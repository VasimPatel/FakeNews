(Robert Frank) \\nRobert H. Frank is one of America\\u2019s leading economists. In addition to reams of textbooks, he has written a number of books looking at the impact of the nation\\u2019s widening income gap and the habits of the people who inhabit the economic stratosphere. The most recent is Success and Luck: Good Fortune and the Myth of Meritocracy . Recently, he stopped by the offices of BillMoyers.com for a conversation about the economic challenges facing the nation and the issues that he thinks the next president will have to address. This transcript has been edited lightly for length and clarity. \\nKathy Kiely: So tell me a little bit about, Robert Frank, your intellectual history. How did you come to be so interested in income inequality? \\nRobert Frank: I started writing about competition for rank back in the early 1980s, late 1970s. The standard economic models assume that people care only about their absolute levels of consumption \\u2014 you know, how big is their house, how fast is their car \\u2014 in absolute terms. But those kinds of evaluations are almost always heavily context-dependent, so if you ask yourself, \\u201cIs my house okay?\\u201d the answer to that question would depend really on the context that you\\u2019re in. \\nI was a Peace Corps volunteer before I went to graduate school and I lived in a two-room house with no electricity, no plumbing, in rural Nepal. Never once during the two years I lived in that house did it ever occur to me for an instant that the house was unsatisfactory in any way. It was a really quite nice house actually, in the context where I was living then. If I lived in a house like that in Ithaca, or any US city really, my kids would\\u2019ve been ashamed for their friends to see where we lived. It would\\u2019ve been shameful for me to have people know that we lived in a house like that. It would be a clear signal that I\\u2019d failed in some spectacular way to meet even the minimal expectations of society. \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nAnd so, you know, is my house okay? The answer is that depends, and it depends on context and the context is very local. \\nSo if context matters, then the standard economic models that assume it doesn\\u2019t matter lead you to many wrong conclusions. So I\\u2019ve been writing about that now for 35 years. And the entry point for inequality is that, as I say, context is local, but for technological reasons, which I\\u2019ve written about elsewhere too, we\\u2019ve seen a move to markets that Phil Cook and I call winner take all markets . \\nThese are \\u2014 I mean, in your industry it\\u2019s very prominent. You don\\u2019t need the local newspaper columnist or radio reporter. Everything is available on the internet to everyone at any moment, and so whoever is best at the particular task at hand, that person gets the whole market. It\\u2019s not quite that exaggerated, but that\\u2019s the trend that we\\u2019ve been seeing, and with that have come many benefits. It\\u2019s better to consume the best than the third best. \\nThe Winner-Take-All Effect \\nBut at the same time, it\\u2019s led to an enormous concentration of economic rewards in the hands of the people who are judged to be best. They\\u2019re often best by only a barely perceptible margin. Maybe they\\u2019re not even best. Maybe they just got a lucky break and came to people\\u2019s attention before the truly best performer did and then the initial success built on itself. \\nBut anyway, the trend has been for income to concentrate at the top of the ladder, and when that happens \\u2014 you know, people at the top of the ladder are normal. They do what you and I do, what everyone else does when they have more income. They spend it and they build bigger houses, they buy more expensive automobiles, they take more expensive vacations, the diamonds they get for their partners are bigger. All those things are normal, and there\\u2019s no indication I\\u2019ve ever seen that people in the middle class get angry about that. If anything, they\\u2019re interested. They want to see pictures of the mansions and the yachts and read about what the rich people do. \\nKiely: Then why are people so angry in this election? \\nFrank: The translation of what the people at the top do to the people in the middle is indirect. The people in the middle, as I say, don\\u2019t seem to care that the people at the top have a lot. You\\u2019re right, now there does seem to be some concern that people like Donald Trump, who claims to have billions, also admits to not having paid any federal income tax for a long time. That I think does arouse anger and concern across a pretty broad spectrum of the population. But in terms of the actual things rich people buy, I think most people feel that the people at the top earned their money fair and square\\u2014that\\u2019s true in some cases, not true in others. \\nBut the people just below the top, they travel in the same social circles as the people at the top. They go to the same weddings, the same parties, the same gatherings, they belong to the same clubs. When they see that the very richest people are now hosting their daughters\\u2019 wedding receptions at home rather than in a hotel or country club, they then feel, \\u201cWe need a ballroom,\\u201d so they build a bigger house. \\nThen there\\u2019s a group just below them, maybe it\\u2019s the custom now to have dinner parties for 24, not 18: \\u201cWe need a bigger dining room.\\u201d They build bigger, and one step at a time, it cascades all the way down the income ladder. And unless you invoke something like that spending cascade is what I call it, you can\\u2019t really make sense of the fact that the family in the middle, the median earner, whose real income is essentially the same as it was four decades ago, why is that family buying a house that\\u2019s 50 percent bigger than what the median family bought four decades ago? What\\u2019s driving that? It\\u2019s not that they have more money. That\\u2019s not the reason for it. \\nKiely: Is it keeping up with the Joneses on steroids? \\nFrank: I\\u2019ve never liked that term. Somebody who\\u2019s trying to \\u2014 but, yes, in a manner of speaking, it is that. The term to me evokes a deep human frailty. Somebody is trying to appear richer that he is. He\\u2019s insecure, he\\u2019s trying to mimic a standard that he\\u2019s not really entitled to on the merits of his own income. \\nSo, yes, that a pejorative term in my experience of how people use it, and the phenomenon I\\u2019m trying to call attention to would exist even if there were none of that. So the median family, it\\u2019s gone into debt to buy a house that\\u2019s at least 50 or 75 percent more expensive than what the median family was spending in 1970. \\nWhy Context Matters \\nThe reason it\\u2019s done that is much less because they envy the houses of other people like them. It\\u2019s because unless you spend as much as other people like you are spending on a house, your kids will go to bad schools. The link between school quality and neighborhood house prices in the school areas is very strong and direct. The better schools are located in the neighborhoods where the houses are more expensive. So if you\\u2019re the family in the middle and it\\u2019s your aim to have your kids attend a school of just average quality \\u2014 you know, we would judge harshly a parent who wasn\\u2019t at least that ambitious \\u2014 then what do you have to do? You have to buy a house that\\u2019s roughly near the price of what people like you are spending on houses. \\nWhen all the families in that middle of the income distribution do that, what do they achieve? Nothing. You know, they just bid up the prices of the houses in the better school districts. Still half of all kids go to bottom-half schools, the exact same as before. But now families are in debt, they\\u2019re not able to meet their bills month by month. Many of them file for bankruptcy. It\\u2019s just been an enormous squeeze on the people in the middle, and that\\u2019s driven by the spending at the top. And the reason we see more of it now is that the spending on the top is so much greater in relation to spending elsewhere in the income distribution. \\nThat\\u2019s happened before. You know, when do you read about luxury? You read about it when the people at the top have been pulling away from everyone else. We read about it in the Gilded Age, the great fortunes of the late 19 th century. You notice it when there\\u2019s that contrast. But it\\u2019s still going on under normal circumstances. Right after World War II, incomes were growing at about the same rate for families up and down the income ladder and it was still true that what the family in the middle spent on a house depended on what the people at the top spent, but it wasn\\u2019t \\u2014 there was growth in balance up and down the line, so we didn\\u2019t notice that families were getting squeezed relative to last year. Those stories didn\\u2019t break through. \\nAgain, it\\u2019s context. If you saw a seventh grader in the third grade, everybody would notice and remark on that. If you see a seven-footer at an NBA game, it\\u2019s normal.\", \"source_id\": 20424, \"article_id\": 335017}"
