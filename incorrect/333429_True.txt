One of his daughters has since moved to Saudi Arabia where she has married. \\nThe family could be receiving more than \\u00a3320,000 a year in benefits according to a financial manager on the Employers\\u2019 Association website. \\nThere is no official confirmation on this figure. \\nUnder Islamic tradition, the 49-year-old can have up to four wives \\u2013 as long as he can support them financially. \\nDon\\u2019t forget everyone, all cultures are equal so you have to respect a culture that says it\\u2019s okay to have four wives and 22 children that the rest of society supports. \\nSince Germany doesn\\u2019t legally recognize polygamy \\u2014 being a civilized country and all (not for long) \\u2014 they couldn\\u2019t all live together and get benefits. But don\\u2019t worry, Ghazia found a way to be compliant with the law and get German taxpayers on the hook for his lifestyle. Isn\\u2019t multiculturalism just swell? \\nHow it works is that Ghazia chose a \\u201cmain wife,\\u201d and now the other three and their children get government benefits to support them. \\nGhazia, his main wife, and their five children live in Montabaur, which is located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. His other wives and children are spread around up to 31 miles away. \\nBack in Syria, Ghazia worked in a garage and car hire service, but ever since he settled in Germany and received government benefits for his family, he just can\\u2019t seem to find the time to work anymore. \\nHe claimed that he wants to work, but because of his religion he has to make sure he spends enough time with each family. Ghazia told German newspaper Bild: \\u201cIn our religion it is my duty to visit every family and to be with them.\\u201d \\nSergei Jaufmann, a neighbor of Ghazia, said according to the Express: \\u201cThe children play football in the street. The mother I often see, when [she] comes from shopping.\\u201d \\nAccording to the Express, a social media user noted that \\u201cthe Syrian with 4 women and 23 children is now being sold to us as a new normality.\\u201d \\nYes it is. This is a prime example of how globalists are actively working to tear down the western world. Refugees and immigrants aren\\u2019t expected to assimilate to the culture; the culture is expected to adapt to them. And not only that, you get to pay for it. \\nSorry, all cultures aren\\u2019t equal and people from around the world that are clamoring to get into the west \\u2014 aside from the terrorists that we\\u2019re supposed to pretend aren\\u2019t abusing immigrant/refugee streams \\u2014 know that full well, which is why they want to come here and take advantage of what western culture built.\"}"
