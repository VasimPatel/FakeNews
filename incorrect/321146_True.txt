The former prosecutor could now be in line for attorney general.\\nNewt Gingrich The ex-House speaker became a top adviser and television spokesperson for Trump during the campaign and was even among the real estate mogul's finalists for running mate. He is said to be interested in becoming secretary of State.\\nBob Corker The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee could also be a possibility to lead the State Department.\\nBen Carson A onetime Trump rival, Carson emerged as one of Trump's most steadfast surrogates.

He could be in line for Defense secretary or some other national security position.\\nJeff Sessions During the primary campaign, Sessions became the first sitting member of the U.S. Senate to endorse Trump's campaign. Now, the Alabama senator could be another possibility to lead the Pentagon.\\nReince Priebus The chairman of the Republican National Committee \\u0097 which ran the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operation \\u0097 could wind up as Trump's White House chief of staff.\\nSteve Mnuchin Trump's finance chairman, formerly of Goldman Sachs, is in line to possibly become Treasury secretary.\\nChris Christie Though shadowed by the recent Bridgegate trial, the New Jersey governor has been a fixture at Trump's side since endorsing him in February and will likely have his eye on a spot in the new administration at the Justice Department or in the White House.\\nSteve Bannon The Breitbart News executive became Trump's campaign CEO in August. He could be in line for a spot as a White House adviser.\\nMike Pence\\nWhile his job is already known \\u0097 vice president \\u0097 the Indiana governor and former congressman is expected to play a large role in the Trump administration as a partner to the new president, who lacks any experience serving in government.\", \"source_id\": 6526, \"article_id\": 321146}"
