"{\"title\": \"UDAN effect: Bengaluru techies demand air taxi services to cross Silk Board\", \"content\": \"Tweet (Image via mygovernmentschemes.com) \\nA week after the Government of India announced its new Regional Connectivity Plan for the Aviation industry called the UDAN scheme, a group of techies in Bangalore have now written to the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) demanding that it too start air transport services. \\nIn an exclusive to The Unreal Times , Nikhil Chaudhary, one of the techies behind this ingenious proposal told us, \\u201cYou know the traffic situation. By the time we cross Silk Board, the Prime Minister goes to some foreign nation, signs an agreement, posts a selfie and comes back to India. By the time we cross Marathahalli, Talgo has completed its trials of a train from Delhi to Mumbai. This was getting too much for us. Now, with UDAN, we can actually get stuck less in traffic. The government has proposed a maximum of Rs. 2500 per hour for a flight. Given that it takes us more than an hour to cross Silk Board or Marathahalli, this seems like a good move. The only problem is that the Minister says anyone with hawai chappal can now fly, but our dress code doesn\\u2019t permit hawai chappal .\\u201d \\nWhen contacted, an official of the BMTC confirmed that they had received the demand. He said, \\u201cThis will require a lot of work. First we sign the papers, send to the MD, she signs it and then it goes to the minister, he signs and then it goes to the dustbin. It will take us time to process it after that.\\u201d \\nMeanwhile, on hearing this, Uber and Ola excitedly announced new plans for air-based taxis. \\nAn Ola official confirmed this. Speaking to our correspondent, he said, \\u201cWe have run Ola Boats in Chennai during the floods, we were planning Ola Tanks to navigate Delhi\\u2019s garbage mountains, why not go for a Helicopter? We can take off anywhere, land anywhere. We\\u2019ll charge per kilometre, per minute and of course, take-off and landing charges will be applicable. We\\u2019ll also bring back Ola Caf\\u00e9 and name it Ola Sky Caf\\u00e9 for our riders. We will run special services just to cross Silk Board and Marathahalli. \\nWhen contacted, Uber too, said that they were serious about launching such services. \\u201cWe have been investing a lot into driverless cars, but have concluded that cars will get involved in accidents in no time in India, so we decided to focus only on air-based taxis. While we are still researching on it abroad, in India we will take it forward with immediate effect,\\u201d said an Uber official. \\u201cWe have earlier given our Customers Helicopter rides, now we\\u2019ll give them plane rides in Bangalore city itself.\\u201d When we asked him where they\\u2019d be able to find a runway for the plane to take off from, he smiled and said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll just have to take a leaf from Nitin Gadkari\\u2019s book and use Ring Road as a runway.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 19928, \"article_id\": 334479}"
