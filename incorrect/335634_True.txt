Though it is still unclear what Mr. Trump will do as president, AMP\\u2019s concerns stem from comments and promises he made during his campaign. \\nSpecifically, AMP asserts the status of Jerusalem has not been resolved and supports Palestinians\\u2019 rights to Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. AMP rejects the promises Mr. Trump made to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September to declare Jerusalem as the \\u201cundivided capital of Israel.\\u201d AMP strongly opposes moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and also is deeply troubled by comments suggesting a Trump administration would forgo the idea of a Palestinian state. \\nIf Mr. Trump follows up on his campaign promises, it would be a departure from the position of previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, which always understood such actions would undermine U.S credibility and influence throughout the world in general, and in the Middle East in particular. \\nIsraeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett said yesterday the notion of a Palestinian state would not have to be considered under Trump\\u2019s administration. \\u201cTrump\\u2019s victory is an opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the center of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause. \\u2026 This is the position of the president-elect\\u2026 The era of a Palestinian state is over,\\u201d Bennett was quoted as saying. \\n\\u201cAt the beginning of his candidacy, Mr. Trump insisted he would be even-handed in his dealings with the Palestinians and Israelis,\\u201d said Dr. Osama Abuirshaid, expert analyst and national director of policy for AMP. \\u201cWe already are in a weakened position in the Middle East because of some current U.S. policies. Mr. Trump\\u2019s promises are not in the best interest of the United States.\\u201d \\nHe added, \\u201cIf Mr. Trump\\u2019s promises were to be implemented, it could hurt our stance throughout the world. They certainly would not have the backing of our global partners and could hurt our national security.\\u201d \\nAMP continues to call for an end to Israel\\u2019s military occupation of Palestine, including its 10-year siege on the Gaza Strip. \\n\\u201cWe hope the Trump administration will be open to working to ensure justice for everyone in the Middle East,\\u201d Abuirshaid said. \\u201cBarring that, we will continue during the next four years to build our base among progressive elements in society, as well with those who work on social justice issues in the interfaith community and communities of color. AMP will continue to advocate for Palestinian human rights by providing accurate information and through contextualizing the Palestinian struggle as one that is just and in accordance with international humanitarian law and international law.\\u201d Related Posts:\"}"
