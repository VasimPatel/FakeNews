"{\"content\": \"Friday 4 November 2016 by Davywavy NewsThump declared an Enemy of the People \\nTreasonous lickspittle \\u201ccomedy\\u201d website NewsThump has been declared an Enemy of the People today after expressing a general preference for the supremacy of Parliament. \\nThe site, which was run by a cabal of international financiers, homosexuals and fencers from a light industrial estate just outside Kettering, treacherously suggested that a system of checks and balances within a Democracy was a pretty good idea and were immediately denounced by popular tribunes for their sedition. \\nContributors to the site have been accused of supporting foreign interests, including buying expensive continental lagers in preference to Carling. \\nManaging Editor, Simon Williams, has been taken into custody and will be tried and hanged \\u2013 because it\\u2019s important to have a trial even when the outcome isn\\u2019t in doubt. \\nA new editor has been democratically elected and will only run popular comedy stories, including the hilarious \\u2018Purge Parliament of Perfidy!\\u2019, \\u201cBuy British-made jams to further strengthen our economic progress!\\u201d, and \\u201cLet us thoroughly implement our Party\\u2019s policy of putting all the people under arms and turning the whole country into a fortress!\\u201d, which Kim Jong-Un has given his generous permission to use. \\nSpeaking to reporters from loyal publications, a spokesman for The People explained that \\u2018The so-called law\\u2019 was merely \\u2018advisory\\u2019 and should be set aside at times when more important considerations over-ruled it. \\n\\u201cYes, yes, Britain has a \\u2018constitution\\u2019 and \\u2018laws\\u2019 and \\u2018checks and balances\\u2019, but these are outdated, petty ideas from a less civilised time; a barbaric holdover from the past,\\u201d he explained. \\n\\u201cFrom now on we\\u2019ll just hold a vote on everything people want. There\\u2019s going to be one on Tuesday about everyone getting a pony. \\n\\u201cAnd if I\\u2019ve not got my free pony by Friday, heads will roll, let me tell you.\\u201d \", \"article_id\": 322930, \"title\": \"NewsThump declared an Enemy of the People\", \"source_id\": 8365}"
