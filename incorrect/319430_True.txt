And because he\\u2019s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I\\u2019m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we\\u2019ve all lost, for the family we can still save, let\\u2019s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all,\\u201d Obama stated. \\nBiden launched a high-profile push last year to find a cure for cancer, which kills millions of people around the world every year, after his oldest son, Beau, died from brain cancer in May. \\nIn October, Biden announced that he would not enter the US presidential race, saying after the death of his son he lacks the emotional energy required to put up a good fight against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. \\nBiden\\u2019s wife, Jill, said she was disappointed her husband decided not to seek the Democratic nomination. \\u201cI believed he would\\u2019ve been the best president,\\u201d she said. \\nIn his comments on Tuesday night, Biden said his priority will be increasing public and private funds to fight cancer. \\n\\u201cThe federal government will do everything it possibly can\\u200a\\u2014 through funding, targeted incentives, and increased private-sector coordination\\u200a\\u2014 to support research and enable progress,\\u201d Biden wrote in a blog post. \\nBiden compared the commitment to fighting cancer to President John F. Kennedy\\u2019s dedication to send American scientists to the moon more than five decades ago: \\u201cThis is our moonshot.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 4790, \"article_id\": 319430}"
