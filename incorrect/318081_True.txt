"{\"content\": \"LISTEN: GOP Insider Reveals Truth About Who\\u2019s REALLY Behind Republican Civil War \\n\\u201cAnd one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest,\\u201d Clinton said. \\u201cHe loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman \\u2018Miss Piggy.\\u2019 Then he called her \\u2018Miss Housekeeping,\\u2019 because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.\\u201d \\nClinton wanted women to think she was standing up for this beauty queen \\u2014 and all other women \\u2014 by bringing this to voters\\u2019 attention. The truth was that the former secretary of state had known about the issue since at least Dec. 2015 but said nothing about it until the timing suited her own interests. \\nIn fact, a 157-page opposition research file was emailed to Clinton\\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta by her campaign\\u2019s research director Tony Carrk.   \\nAlong with information about Trump, the file contained research files on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, two of Trump\\u2019s main rivals in the GOP primaries. \\nPodesta\\u2019s emails were among those hacked by WikiLeaks, and more than 25,000 of them have been released so far by the group. \\nWe cannot allow Clinton to convince people that she is the candidate for women\\u2019s issues, or even looking out for women\\u2019s \\u2014 or anyone else\\u2019s \\u2014 best interests. \\nThe fact is that she cares about one thing \\u2014 winning, at all costs.  \", \"source_id\": 3476, \"article_id\": 318081, \"title\": \"REVEALED: Hillary Sat on Sex Misconduct Allegations Against Trump for MONTHS\"}"
