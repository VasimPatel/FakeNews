Khan, a former Pakistan cricket star who turned politician, has described the upcoming mass protest as a final push to force Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to resign over corruption allegations.

Sharif's family denies any wrongdoing. \\nPeople in Pakistan, with Imran Khan at the helm, are asking for an inquiry to determine how Sharif\\u2019s children made all that money to buy offshore companies and real estate in London's prime locations, and whether they had paid their due tax on their income.
