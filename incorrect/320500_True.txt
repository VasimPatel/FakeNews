"{\"source_id\": 5935, \"content\": \"\\u201cVicu\\u00f1a,\\u201d the new play that opened Sunday at Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, Calif., portrays a Donald Trump-like candidate in an \\u201cEmperor\\u2019s New Clothes\\u201d tale. The satire about a real estate tycoon and reality TV star turned presidential candidate could be perceived as a hatchet job. However, it offers an entertaining topical comedy on the surface, with glimpses into the climate of fear and xenophobia that has spread across America.\\nThe improbable, uncontrollable Republican candidate here, Kurt Seaman (a name that results in sophomoric jokes that take away from the effort), bears an obvious resemblance to Trump. The mogul \\u201cwants to add the White House to his list of properties,\\u201d as one character notes. The Trumpisms include the well- respected daughter (called Srilanka here), ex-wives with names that evoke Trump\\u2019s, negative attitudes toward immigrants and even an uncomfortable feeling in his party that he will hurt them on Election Day.\\n\\u201cVicu\\u00f1a\\u201d clearly evolved with the election since the Jon Robin Baitz play (his fourth world premiere for the Center Theatre Group) was drafted earlier this year. It takes place as preparations are under way for the third debate between Seaman (played by Harry Groener) and his unseen female opponent, who clearly did better in the first two debates.\\nDirected by Robert Egan, most of the play\\u2019s action takes place in a posh tailor\\u2019s atelier, where the character Anselm Kassar (played by Brian George), an Iranian Jewish immigrant, designs garments for presidents and world leaders that create the illusion of power and confidence. The character is based on an actual Washington, D.C., tailor named Georges de Paris, a Greek immigrant who crafted suits for presidents for decades.\\nSeaman decides that for his last debate he needs a magical, powerful suit made out of the finest vicu\\u00f1a (hence the name) for him by the great presidential tailor. \\u201cClothing conveys credibility,\\u201d is the premise. He believes the polls are lying: \\u201cPeople are afraid to admit they are on my side.\\u201d However, just in case, this emperor wants new clothes.\\nThe tailor decides, ignoring his personal feelings, to make a suit for a candidate that he finds repellent and make him more. He cannot resist the reflected glory of his powerful suits on the wannabe or truly powerful.\\nSeaman is at first delighted to meet the tailor\\u2019s apprentice, Amir Masoud (played by Ramiz Monsef), who is the son of immigrants. He tells him \\u201cApprenticeship is good. It\\u2019s my thing.\\u201d But the candidate\\u2019s world view collides profoundly with this young Muslim man\\u2019s concepts of justice and America. The candidate actually comments that if people cannot make it in their own country and flee, \\u201cwhat kind of people are we letting in?\\u201d\\nAmir serves as the play\\u2019s conscience and challenges the candidate (and his daughter). He points out, \\u201cA suit can\\u2019t stand in for actual goodness and vision.\\u201d Amir\\u2019s character (like others in the play) is uneven and his actions do not always convey his feelings (like taking advantage of his prep school and Harvard University scholarships before flaunting his Marxist leanings.)\\nSrilanka (played by Samantha Sloyan) is tired defending her dad against his inappropriate comments. Initially, she tells Amir, \\u201cHis message is lost when he is not \\u2018disciplined.\\u2019\\u201d The dutiful daughter even boasts that \\u201cwhen he\\u2019s elected he will be far more human than he\\u2019s being painted.\\u201d However, once he speaks positively about woman at her alma mater and then does a disparaging sexist interview, she can no longer ignore his inappropriate comments.\\nThe Republican party leadership cannot ignore his \\u201cpitchfork campaign\\u201d and questionable opinions either. They offer Seaman billions to throw the debate and not become president. The real estate tycoon is now engaged in negotiations \\u201cto buy and sell the presidency.\\u201d\\nThe final scene is the debate, with the candidate and his exquisite vicu\\u00f1a suit. The final act of the real election is yet to be played. But this play\\u2019s final act is veers into darker territory and an \\u201cemperor has no clothes\\u201d type moment.\\nThe Vicu\\u00f1a cast is excellent. Groener avoids the obvious parody, but conveys the appropriate pomposity. Sloyan does a great job displaying early confidence crumbling to vulnerability of Srilanka\\u2019s campaign life. However, the key character is Monsef\\u2019s Amir, and the actor is up to the task of carrying the audience on his journey challenging the candidate\\u2019s beliefs and actions.\\n\\u201cVicu\\u00f1a\\u201d portrays Trump in an \\u201cEmperor\\u2019s New Clothes\\u201d type tale, opening one week before the election. Baitz\\u2019 new play may not have a long shelf life now. However, it raises some serious issues that are not going away on Nov. 9. Maybe the play will be dusted off years from now and presented as a dramedy based on actual people. But, in the meantime, the reality is a little too real as election day looms.\\nWritten and Edited by Dyanne Weiss\\nSources:\\nPerformance Oct. 30\\nCenter Theatre Group : Vicu\\u00f1a\\nLos Angeles Times: Q&A The timely new play \\u2018Vicu\\u00f1a\\u2019 is, and isn\\u2019t, about Donald Trump\\nPhotos of Groener (top) and Monsef and Sloyan by Craig Schwartz. courtesy of Center Theatre Group. baitz , Center Theatre Group , Kirk Douglas , vicu\\u00f1a\", \"title\": \"New Play Vicu\\u00f1a Portrays Trump in \\u201cEmperor\\u2019s New Clothes\\u201d Tale\", \"article_id\": 320500}"
