We have seen that elected officials are just failing to do anything about it,\\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project. (Wisconsin Jobs Now/cc/flickr) \\nVoters, \\u201ctired of waiting\\u201d for federal lawmakers, will soon be casting their ballot in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and Washington to raise the grossly inadequate minimum wage and, advocates hope, raise the standard of living for roughly 2.1 million Americans. \\nWhile none of the four ballot measures goes so far as to call for the $15 an hour wage that has been the rallying cry of the low wage worker movement and which became a pillar of Sen. Bernie Sanders\\u2019 presidential campaign, the initiatives signify a determination among Americans that it is high time to demand \\u201can economy that can work for everyone.\\u201d \\n\\u201cWe all know that our economy is broken. We have seen that elected officials are just failing to do anything about it,\\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project. \\u201cThe best way for us to make the changes that impact working Americans immediately is not to wait for politicians to figure this out but for us to support ballot measures that allow voters to speak out.\\u201d \\nThus far, polls in all four states show that voters believe a wage increase is \\u201clong overdue and desperately needed,\\u201d added Schleifer, whose organization helped launch and finance the ballot measures. \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\n\\u201cWe are confident that when working Americans see raises in their paychecks even before the next President is inaugurated,\\u201d he said, \\u201cthe success of these measures will inspire even more ballot initiatives in the coming years.\\u201d \\nArizona Proposition 206 \\nA \\u201cyes\\u201d vote on Proposition 206 , known as the Fair Wages and Healthy Families Initiative, would raise the state\\u2019s minimum wage from $8.05 to $10 in 2017, and then incrementally to $12 by 2020. It also establishes the right to paid sick time off from employment. \\nRecent polling by Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News found that roughly 58 percent of voters support the measure, with 31 opposed, and another 10 percent still undecided. \\n\\u201cEnthusiasm for Proposition 206 has only gotten stronger over the course of this election season,\\u201d Bill Scheel, campaign manager of Arizona Healthy Families , the organization behind Proposition 206, said in a Wednesday press call. \\u201cOver the past three months, we have registered 150,000 new voters. Already, early vote numbers are showing that these Arizonans are crucial to raising wages for nearly a million workers in our state.\\u201d \\nThe initiative has the support of a number of labor unions, family support groups, as well as the state Democratic party. \\n\\u201cNo one who works 40 hours a week should have to live in poverty and decide between buying groceries, medicine, or paying the bills. Raising the minimum wage offers hardworking families the opportunity to put food on the table, care for their children, and creates a better future for our state,\\u201d said U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-1), who is running against incumbent Sen. John McCain (R) for his seat in the U.S. Senate. \\nMcCain opposes the measure, as do corporate lobby groups and the Chamber of Commerce. \\nColorado Amendment 70 \\nColorado\\u2019s Amendment 70 , an initiated constitutional amendment, would raise the minimum wage from $8.31 to $9.30 per hour in 2017 and then increase it 90 cents each year until it reaches $12.00 in 2020. \\nSeptember polling found that roughly 58 percent of voters are in support of the measure, while 36 percent are opposed. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve known all along that Colorado voters support raising the wage to $12 by 2020 and that for many of them, especially lower income voters and women, they are more enthusiastic voters in this election because of our measure,\\u201d said Patty Kupfer, campaign manager for Colorado Families for a Fair Wage , the organization supporting Amendment 70. \\nAs Kupfer notes, the initiative\\u2019s primary opponents are industry groups and \\u201clarge restaurant chains who have an interest in keeping wages low.\\u201d \\nAmendment 70 is one of many Colorado ballot measures this year that progressives nationwide are watching, in addition to a measure calling for a single payer healthcare system as well as one that would stiffen requirements for amending the state\\u2019s constitution, which, as Common Dreams previously reported , \\u201cwould transfer power away from voters, making the state more vulnerable to powerful interests.\\u201d \\nMaine Question 4 \\nQuestion 4 on the Maine ballot asks voters if they \\u201cwant to raise the minimum hourly wage of $7.50 to $9 in 2017, with annual $1 increases up to $12 in 2020, and annual cost-of-living increases thereafter?\\u201d \\nThe citizen-initiated effort also seeks to raise the wages for tipped workers \\u201cfrom half the minimum wage to $5 in 2017, with annual $1 increases until it reaches the adjusted minimum wage.\\u201d \\nA poll conducted between Oct. 20 and Oct. 25 found that 57 percent of Mainers support the wage increase, while just 35 percent oppose it, and eight percent remain undecided. Proponents attribute its wide support to two years of organizing to build grassroots support and \\u201cestablish a narrative of an economy that can work for everyone, as Mike Tipping, communications director with Mainers for Fair Wages , the organization supporting Question 4, put it in a recent press call. \\nNoting that the measure has strong support \\u201cacross every demographic,\\u201d including among small businesses and restaurants, Tipping said he\\u2019s \\u201cproud to see this enthusiasm translate into more young people voting and more Mainers voting early to raise the minimum wage.\\u201d \\nWashington Initiative 1433 \\nThe most ambitious of the 2016 ballot efforts, Washington State\\u2019s Initiative 1433 supports incrementally raising the state\\u2019s minimum wage from $9.47 to $13.50 by 2020 and mandates that employers offer paid sick leave. \\n\\u201cPaid sick leave and minimum wage are issues that have had a deep effect on working families and drive support for our initiative at the polls,\\u201d said Carlo Caldirola-Davis, campaign manager for Raise Up Washington , the organization supporting Initiative 1433. \\u201cVoters understand that hard working Washingtonians should be able to care for their families and make ends meet.\\u201d \\nThe most recent survey from pollster Stuart Elway found that I-1433 is leading 58 to 31 percent, with 11 percent undecided. The initiative has wide support, and has been endorsed by numerous publications, advocacy organizations, labor groups, and public officials, including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who last spring tweeted: We have to do more to raise wages & support paid leave for hardworking families. I stand with @Raise_Up_WA in their work to do just that. -H \\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 4, 2016 \\nIn 2014, Seattle became the first major city to approve a $15 minimum wage. \\nLauren McCauley is a staff writer at Common Dreams.
