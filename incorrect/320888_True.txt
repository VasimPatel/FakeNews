Her supporters are \\u201cf*cking dumb\\u201d\\u2026 \\nA new email released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta dump reveals what the Clinton campaign really thinks of their millennial supporters. \\nMarketing Executive Wendy Bronfein, who was introduced to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta in another email as someone who \\u201ccould be immensely helpful in improving HRC\\u2019s connection to millennials,\\u201d advises on how to reach \\u201cf**king dumb\\u201d young people. \\nAccording to infowars , Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton \\u201cmay not be the best face\\u201d to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize \\u201ctrending figures\\u201d as part of an \\u201cinfusion to pull younger voters\\u201d because \\u201cthat\\u2019s the crap that young people pay attention to.\\u201d \\nShe goes on to state, \\u201cIt\\u2019s f**king dumb but being \\u201ccool\\u201d counts for more than it maybe should.\\u201d \\n\\u201cI hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they \\u201cfollow\\u201d. So if someone they identify as cool endorses \\u2013 they will likely fall in line with that candidate,\\u201d writes Bronfein. \\nTake a look\\u2026 \\nThis is not the first time Clinton and her team have demeaned their own voter base. It was revealed in another email that Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accused Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being \\u201cstupid.\\u201d \\nAnd in an audio recording leaked earlier this month, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape saying that Bernie Sanders supporters are \\u201cliving in their parents\\u2019 basement\\u201d and had bought into a \\u201cfalse promise.\\u201d \\nIn yet another email, Clinton operative Bill Ivey spoke of the need to maintain political power by producing \\u201can unaware and compliant citizenry.\\u201d \\nIndeed, WikiLeaks has been the gift that keeps on giving. \\nSHARE this report to EXPOSE what Hillary Clinton REALLY thinks of the people voting for her!\"}"
