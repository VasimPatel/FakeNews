"{\"title\": \"Swedish MP quits in disgust at Jewish ownership of media \\u2014 Includes short video by Red Ice Radio\", \"content\": \"Other Writers \\nSwedish Democrat party member of Parliament Anna Hagwall has announced her resignation from all party posts and will not stand for reelection in 2018 after a furor following her exposure of the fact that a single family of Jews control the Swedish media. One Jewish family helps to brainwash the entire population of Sweden. This Swedish MP has had ENOUGH! \\nThe uproar followed her letter to the Aftonbladet newspaper in which she said that \\u201cethnicity should be a factor\\u201d in determining media ownership of more than 5 percent\\u2014an obvious reference to the Jewish Bonnier family media group. \\nThe Bonnier Group owns 96 book publishers, 42 business and trade press newspapers, 105 digital news platforms, 9 film production companies, 176 magazines, 23 major newspapers, 33 TV stations, and 33 \\u201cother\\u201d media outlets\\u2014and quite literally dominates the controlled media in Sweden. \\nHagwall had earlier submitted a motion to the Swedish parliament which proposed cuts to the state subsidies paid to media in Sweden. \\nAlthough she never mentioned Jews by name, Hagwall said in an explanatory letter to the Aftonbladet that it would be a good idea to \\u201clet Bonnier\\u2019s newspapers go under\\u201d so that \\u201cno family, ethnic group, or company\\u201d could control more than 5 percent of the media. \\n\\u201cAn entire 80 percent of the media is owned and controlled by the same owners,\\u201d Hagwell wrote. \\u201cThis is not acceptable. Therefore, media ownership should be spread over many independent companies and people. In order to change this, I suggest press subsidies [only] for the independent media.\\u201d \\nWhen asked by Aftonbladet how the abolition of press subsidies to the country\\u2019s local newspapers reduce Bonnier\\u2019s power over the media in Sweden, Hagwall answered by email that \\u201cmost small newspapers are directly or indirectly controlled by Bonnier, and why they have to be subsidized by the Swedish taxpayer is a mystery. \\n\\u201cLet the little Bonnier newspapers in the provinces go under, because then a void will be created which can be filled by newspapers that care about people and business owners.\\u201d \\nShe also said that the Swedish public service broadcaster, Sveriges Television (SVT), should be switched to pay channels to \\u201creduce SVT\\u2019s propagation of the politically correct agenda.\\u201d \\nThe comments provoked a stream of attacks upon Hagwall, and the Swedish Democrat leadership also distanced itself from her, saying in a statement that the matter will \\u201caffect her future in the party.\\u201d \\nThis week, Hagwall resigned her position as member of the Parliamentary Committee on Taxation and internal group leader of the Sweden Democrats\\u2019 tax policy group. She also will not seek reelection to Parliament in 2018 at the request of the party leadership, and it is currently unclear if she will continue to sit in parliament for the remainder of the current term.\", \"source_id\": 4019, \"article_id\": 318563}"
