"{\"content\": \"Law enforcement in North Dakota is running out of money protecting the Dakota Access oil pipeline. \\n\\nA legislative committee will be reviewing an emergency request to borrow more money from the Bank of North Dakota to cover the cost of law enforcement\\u2019s involvement in the Dakota Access pipeline protests. \\n\\nThe department has used an increasing amount of money since the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, which was supposed to be saved for natural disasters, but is now used to protect the pipeline that is planned to go through 1851 treaty land. \\n\\nTo fight for companies behind the DAPL, officers from at least 6 states have been deployed. North Dakota is responsible for reimbursing out-of-state police agencies for costs that have to do with wages, overtime, officer benefits, meals while on duty, a per diem while off duty, lodging and mileage for the communities that sent vehicles. \\n\\nGovernor Jack Dalrymple will vote on Tuesday, November 8th on whether to borrow $4 million from the state-owned bank. \\n\\nThe panel has already borrowed and spent $6 million from the bank in September. \\n\\nNorth Dakota officials have also requested federal officials to reimburse the state for the additional law enforcement costs. \\n\\nAll of this money going towards the police brings a lot into question. How much taxpayer money will be used to protect the investment of a company over investments on human health? How much money is given to law enforcement, military, and corporations in order to silence the people fighting for justice? \\n\\n \", \"source_id\": 17078, \"title\": \"$6 Million Later: North Dakota Police Can\\u2019t Afford The Pipeline Protest\", \"article_id\": 331636}"
