Hillary Clinton\\u2019s Wall Street Fundraising Benefited From Loophole In Federal Anti-Corruption Rule By VNN on October 31, 2016 \\u2018Particularly Vulnerable To Pay To Play Practices\\u2019 \\n\\nby David Sirota AND Andrew Perez (MAPLIGHT) AND Avi Asher-Schapiro \\nDespite an anti-corruption rule that was designed to reduce the financial industry\\u2019s political power, top officials from the investment firm BlackRock hosted Hillary Clinton at campaign fundraisers earlier this year. The cash \\u2014 which poured in through a loophole in the law \\u2014 came in as BlackRock\\u2019s federal contracts to manage billions of dollars of retiree assets will be up for renewal during the next president\\u2019s term. \\nIn 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission looked to stop campaign donations to public officials from financial firms seeking to convince those officials to hire them to manage public employees\\u2019 retirement assets. The agency enacted a pay-to-play rule that applied such a restriction to state and local officials. The rule, however, was structured in a way that effectively exempted federal agencies from its restrictions \\u2014 and it was created even though a major federal agency had just been plagued by an investment-related influence-peddling scandal. \\nIn practice, the gap in the rule allows BlackRock executives to raise big money for presidential candidates who \\u2014 if they win \\u2014 will appoint the officials that run the federal Thrift Savings Plan, which awards contracts to manage retirement assets for nearly 5 million current and former federal employees. \\nThe loophole also allows Wall Street executives to give cash to presidential candidates, even as those executives\\u2019 firms get deals to manage \\u2014 and earn fees from \\u2014 investments for the federal government\\u2019s separate pension insurance agency, which is run by presidential appointees. \\nIn all, the loophole in the SEC rule effectively leaves nearly a half-trillion dollars of retirement assets unprotected by the nation\\u2019s major anti-corruption measure. Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign has raised more than $1 million from financial firms that are contracted to manage those assets. \\nTwo SEC spokespeople, Ryan White and Judith Burns, declined to answer questions from International Business Times and MapLight about the pay-to-play rule carveout for federal agencies. \\n\\u2018Particularly Vulnerable To Pay To Play Practices\\u2019 \\nThis report is part of an IBT/MapLight series examining the extent to which corporate interests are able to circumvent federal and state anti-corruption rules designed to restrict the influence of money on public policy. \\nWhen the SEC passed its rule to restrict Wall Street campaign contributions, the agency said the measure was necessary because publicly administered retirement programs \\u201care particularly vulnerable to pay to play practices\\u201d which can end up \\u201cleading to inferior management, diminished returns or greater losses\\u201d for retirees. A study released last month validated that concern: Researchers at Stanford, Rice and Erasmus universities found that retirement systems whose overseers \\u201chave received relatively more contributions from the financial industry have lower returns.\\u201d \\nFederal regulators ended up prohibiting investment firms from earning fees from \\u201ca government entity\\u201d \\u2014 that is, a retirement system \\u2014 if firm executives donate to a public official who has power to influence the retirement system\\u2019s investment decisions. The rule, though, narrowly defined \\u201cgovernment entity\\u201d: It says the term means only an agency at the state or local level, not the federal government. \\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no clear carve-out for federal plans, but the definition itself also does not insinuate that they are covered,\\u201d Benjamin Keane, an attorney at the law firm Dentons, told IBT/MapLight. \\nThrough legislation, congressional lawmakers could close the loophole by passing a pay-to-play law that defined \\u201cgovernment entity\\u201d to encompass the federal government. Without that, the loophole will remain. \\n\\u2018Wouldn\\u2019t Appear To Put Such Firms At Risk\\u2019 \\nThe result: Pay-to-play restrictions do not apply to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) \\u2014 a $458 billion behemoth that is the single largest retirement system in America. \\nBlackRock officials delivered over $100,000 to President Barack Obama\\u2019s campaigns, and Obama\\u2019s appointees to the TSP\\u2019s board have awarded BlackRock contracts to manage $251 billion on behalf of millions of federal workers. Those contracts were awarded by the Obama administration between 2012 and 2015. \\nNow, with those deals coming up for renewal, BlackRock employees are helping raise big money for Clinton, Obama\\u2019s potential successor. \\nBlackRock official Matt Mallow and his wife are listed on Clinton\\u2019s website as \\u201cHillblazers\\u201d who have raised or donated at least $100,000 for the Democratic candidate\\u2019s 2016 campaign. Mallow hosted a fundraiser for Clinton this past February. Cheryl Mills, a longtime Clinton adviser, also hosted a fundraiser for her and serves on BlackRock\\u2019s board of directors. Clinton\\u2019s campaign has received roughly $100,000 directly from employees of BlackRock. \\nIf Clinton wins the election, the agency her appointees run will decide the fate of BlackRock\\u2019s TSP contracts \\u2014 and there is nothing in the SEC pay-to-play rule to stop those appointees from rewarding Clinton\\u2019s donors. \\n\\u201cSince the Thrift Savings Plan is solely a creature of the federal government,\\u201d Keane told IBT/MapLight, \\u201ccontributions to the president or presidential candidates by covered executives of investment advisors to the TSP wouldn\\u2019t appear to put such firms at risk.\\u201d \\nA TSP spokesperson, Kim Weaver, confirmed to IBT/MapLight that \\u201cthe SEC has no jurisdiction\\u201d over the board that governs the retirement system. \\nWhile TSP management contracts involve relatively low fees, the deals are coveted. The TSP does not publish an itemized list of the exact fees it pays to outside money managers, but documents reviewed by IBT show that the TSP pays about $106 million in annual expenses for the specific funds that BlackRock manages. \\nBlackRock likely earns additional revenues through securities lending, in which it can lend out portfolio assets to other firms for a fee. BlackRock can also use TSP\\u2019s holdings to exert influence with major corporations. \\nWeaver said the agency \\u201cuses a competitive RFP [request for proposal] process when selecting fund managers. The vendor is selected purely on the basis of best value and the selection is done on a fiduciary basis.\\u201d She said the agency\\u2019s presidentially appointed board members \\u201cdo not serve as selecting officials on any [agency] procurement.\\u201d \\nFederal law says the board sets \\u201cpolicies for the investment and management\\u201d of the TSP, and agency press releases note that the board selected BlackRock for the four investment contracts the firm won. \\n\\u2018Serious Questions About The Integrity Of The Process\\u2019 \\nThe TSP is not the only source of investment business at the federal level: There is also the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , which insures the pensions of 44 million Americans and pays out benefits if private pension systems collapse. PBGC officials currently oversee roughly $88 billion of investments. \\nThe PBGC ( Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ) invests money with 23 financial firms, according to a PBGC spokesperson. Employees at twelve of those firms \\u2014 including J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock \\u2014 have collectively given Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign more than $1.2 million. Goldman Sachs also paid Clinton $675,000 for speeches after she completed her tenure as Secretary of State. Those same firms donated over $870,000 to Obama\\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign. \\nThe PBGC declined to disclose any information on how much in annual fees the agency pays the Wall Street firms, but there are clues about how much at least some of those firms might be making off the system. The agency\\u2019s most recent financial report says roughly 1.7 percent of its assets are in \\u201cprivate equity, private debt, and private real estate.\\u201d That translates to roughly $1.5 billion of such investments. Assuming industry standard fees of up to 2 percent, that one small slice of PBGC investments alone could generate up to $30 million of annual management fees for financial firms \\u2014 on top of any additional fees levied on investment returns. \\nAsked if it is appropriate for the agency to award contracts to firms whose executives make contributions to presidential campaigns, agency spokesman Marc Hopkins told IBT/MapLight: \\u201cPBGC follows federal procurement laws and regulations.\\u201d \\nThe SEC\\u2019s decision to shield the federal government from the pay-to-play rule is striking, given that the PBGC was engulfed in an influence-peddling scandal at the beginning of President Obama\\u2019s term. \\nIn January 2009, Charles E.F. Millard resigned as head of the PBGC amid accusations he inappropriately communicated with firms who were courting lucrative PBGC contracts. A whistleblower told the agency\\u2019s inspector general that Millard had been communicating with Wall Street firms seeking business from the PBGC, and that Millard refused to cut ties even after he was warned of potential ethical violations. \\nThe investigation found that BlackRock and Goldman Sachs assigned employees to win over Millard. BlackRock even tasked a former high school classmate of Millard\\u2019s to keep in touch. \\nGoldman provided Millard with advice about how to persuade his colleagues to invest more PBGC funds in alternative investments, and the PBGC soon picked BlackRock and Goldman to manage nearly $1.6 billion in PBGC assets. \\nThe inspector general said at the time that the \\u201cimproper actions raise serious questions about the integrity of the process by which the winners\\u201d of federal investment contracts were selected. The IG noted that after Millard resigned, a Goldman executive worked to help him find a Wall Street job. Millard \\u2014 who was not criminally charged \\u2014 worked as a managing director and head of pension relations at Citigroup until earlier this year. \\nA few months after the IG report was released, President Obama appointed a private equity executive to take over the agency \\u2014 just as that executive\\u2019s New York firm was facing questions about whether it used political influence to secure public pension deals. A year later, the SEC passed its pay to play rule \\u2014 including the language that made sure the rule did not apply to the PBGC and other federal agencies. \\nAlso see:\", \"source_id\": 20995, \"article_id\": 335573}"
