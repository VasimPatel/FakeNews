"{\"title\": \"Teacher To 11 yr Old: 'I Can't Wait Until Trump Is Elected,He's Going To Deport All You Muslims'\", \"content\": \"0 427 \\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s going to be you,\\u201d the Academy of Excellence teacher allegedly warned a 12-year-old Muslim student after showing the class a movie about the 9/11 attacks. And if that sounds outrageous, brace yourself because it gets a lot worse. \\nNo wonder the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Arizona are siccing the U.S. Dept. of Justice and the U.S. Dept. of Education on this travesty of a public charter school and this shameful example of an educator\\u2019s sorry a**. Heather Weaver from the ACLU\\u2019s national office reports they\\u2019ve filed formal complaints on behalf of the Muslim student and his family. \\nAsli Noor and her five children are refugees who settled in Phoenix, Arizona after fleeing Somalia. Like most parents, she wants opportunities and a good education for her children. And for many families \\u2014 especially those living in low-income neighborhoods \\u2014 that means a public charter school like the sadly misnamed \\u201cExcellence Academy.\\u201d \\nThe boy and his eight-year-old sister (referred to in the complaint as A.A. and F.A.) had started the 2015-2016 school year when the family\\u2019s new set of troubles began. \\nAccording to the complaints, an \\u201cAcademy of Excellence\\u201d teacher named Faye Myles began \\u201csingling out\\u201d the then 11-year-old, sixth grade Muslim student as the 2015-16 school year began for \\u201cdisfavorable treatment because of his faith and nationality.\\u201d \\n\\u2018Another time, when A.A. raised his hand to answer a question, his teacher snapped at him\\u200a\\u2014\\u200a\\u201cAll you Muslims think you are so smart\\u201d\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ain front of the entire class.\\u2019 \\nOh, and then the boy recalls the math and science teacher for grades 5-8 digressing into a special kind of lesson in civics and current events. \\n\\u2018I can\\u2019t wait until Trump is elected. He\\u2019s going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn\\u2019t be given visas. They\\u2019ll probably take away your visa and deport you. You\\u2019re going to be the next terrorist, I bet.\\u2019 \\nFaye Myles also allegedly found other ways to wound her young Muslim student with her bigotry. She repeatedly denied him the right to pray during recess, which is hard to imagine ever happening to a Christian student. The child also claims his \\u201cAcademy of Excellence\\u201d teacher would also would tell him to \\u201cshut up\\u201d and punish him during class \\u201cdowntime\\u201d when the other students were allowed to talk with each other. \\nThe bus rides home added to the child\\u2019s misery as his classmates began to follow the teacher\\u2019s example and pile on the insults. \\n\\u2018On the bus ride home, A.A.\\u2019s classmates took up his teacher\\u2019s anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant crusade, taunting him about the fact that his visa would be revoked because he is a Muslim, calling him a \\u201cterrorist,\\u201d and accusing him of planning to blow up the bus.\\u2019 \\nThe child, of course, started feeling anxious and physically ill \\u201cwith a stomach ache\\u201d and had no desire to return to the \\u201cAcademy of Excellence.\\u201d \\nIn January, Asli Noor met with school officials to complain about these incidents. Three days later, the school asked her to pick her son up early because he had supposedly tried to open the school bus\\u2019 emergency window. Noor demanded they verify these accusations with footage from the security camera but school officials refused. \\nAnd then Brenda Nelson, an \\u201cAcademy of Excellence\\u201d board member, printed out two \\u201cvoluntary\\u201d withdrawal forms for A.A. and his younger sister F.A. She then allegedly ordered Ms. Noor to sign them, saying: \\n\\u2018Get your kids out of here. I don\\u2019t want them here.\\u2019 \\nWhen Asri Noor begged for time to find another school for her children, Brenda Nelson callously refused. \\nUnfortunately, these incidents of anti-Muslim bigotry in publicly-funded schools are happening more frequently. Think Progress reports that even in schools where teachers try to fight it, Trump-inspired bullying is a serious issue. \\n\\u2018In spite of some teachers\\u2019 valiant efforts to teach students about Trump, it would appear that schoolchildren already invoke the candidate\\u2019s name to scare their Latino and Muslim classmates, referencing the candidate\\u2019s harsh claims of Latino criminals and Muslim terrorists.\\u2019 \\nAnd, sadly, it\\u2019s not just the kids. \\n\\u2018A predominantly Latino elementary school in California was graffiti-tagged with the words \\u201cBuild the wall higher\\u201d last week, alluding to Trump\\u2019s policy plan to build a southern U.S. border wall to keep out undocumented immigrants.\\u2019 \\nAnd in case you assume the \\u201cAcademy of Excellence\\u201d teacher is one of those mean white Trump supporters, you\\u2019re wrong. Apparently, she\\u2019s a mean black Trump supporter. @KhaledBeydoun The teacher works at Academy of Excellence & her name is Faye Myles per the article. She should be called out. pic.twitter.com/BbL3YdzEG8 \\n\\u2014 John Q Archibald (@JohnQarchibald) October 30, 2016 \\nFeatured image: Lynn Koenig via Getty Images .
